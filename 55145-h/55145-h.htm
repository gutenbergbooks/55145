<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">PREFACE.</span></h2>
<p>The great advances which have been made within the last few years in the
introduction and the cultivation of Exotic Orchids, have suggested the desirability
of devoting a monthly publication to the illustration of the best forms of these
singular and captivating aristocratic plants, and also to the explanation of the most
successful methods of growing them, its object being to supply such information
concerning them as the Orchid Grower may be likely to find useful in directing
his purchases, and in suggesting the various points of discreet and masterly
management. Moreover, we have found that figures of the better varieties of
Orchids are much in request.</p>
<p>These considerations have induced us to commence the publication of the
<span class="sc">Orchid Album</span>, in the confident expectation that we shall meet with sufficient
support and encouragement to enable us to continue it, and, so far as our experience
goes, we have no reason to feel disappointed, for we find that Orchid growers, both
amateur and professional, are taking a marked interest not only in the plates but
also in the cultural notes.</p>
<p>In regard to the subjects for illustration, we hope in due course to figure not
only the typical form of all the more popular and interesting species, but also the
leading varieties, when they prove sufficiently distinct and meritorious. It is for
these that we anticipate our subscribers and readers will most anxiously look.</p>
<p>Being of Royal Quarto size, the pages of the Album are sufficiently large to
enable the artist to produce ample and intelligible portraits of the plants without
their becoming cumbersome; and, as they will be drawn and coloured in the best
style, we confidently hope they will prove to be acceptable to the lovers and
growers of Orchids generally. Thus we trust we may be permitted to lay before
our patrons an acceptable Annual Album of Floral Pictures, which will be, at once,
welcomed both to the Drawing-room and the Library.</p>
<p>The work has been commenced in deference to the urgent representations of
<span class="pb" id="Page_ii">ii</span>
many of the leading cultivators of these remarkable and fascinating plants, who
have pointed out to us the want which we are now endeavouring to meet. The
great advantage and pleasure which Orchid Growers have derived from the publication
of such illustrated works as the <i>Select Orchidaceous Plants</i>, and such practical
instructions as are given in the <i>Orchid Grower&rsquo;s Manual</i>, lead us to believe that
there exists a desire and a taste for further Orchidic literature, which we trust
the <span class="sc">Orchid Album</span> may in some considerable degree supply. Our chief aim will
be to give authentic information as to the nomenclature of the plants, and to
disseminate correct instructions in regard to their cultural requirements. The finer
new Orchids, as well as the older meritorious species and varieties, will be figured
with equal fidelity, and described with equal accuracy. We shall at all times feel
grateful to those Amateurs or Trade growers who may give us information as to the
flowering either of novelties or of remarkably fine forms of the older kinds, especially
if they are such as will be suitable for figuring.</p>
<p>The Annual Volumes will consist of the twelve Monthly Parts issued up to June
in each year, when the volume will be completed by the publication of a Title Page
and Index.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>The brilliant little plant here figured&mdash;a representation in the tribe <i>Vande&aelig;</i>, of
the great genus <i>Oncidium</i>&mdash;belongs to the group of Oncids which Lindley named
<i>Tetrapetala micropetala</i>, in which two of the sepals are united so that the petaloid
organs, as distinguished from the lip, are reduced to four in number (<i>tetrapetala</i>),
and at the same time the petals, which are about equal in size to the sepals, are
comparatively small by comparison with the remaining organ.</p>
<p>This species, although not new, was until recently extremely rare, and was, indeed,
seldom met with in collections; now, however, the little gem is very plentiful,
thanks to the indefatigable zeal of our collectors, so that growers who do not possess
it may obtain it at a very small cost. The species is one of the most compact-growing
and beautiful of the <i>Oncidiums</i>, producing, as it does, from the base of the
new bulbs, many-flowered drooping spikes of rich yellow blossoms. It is an excellent
subject for planting in a pan or basket to be suspended from the roof of the
house, where the brightly-coloured flowers produce a charming effect; indeed, we do
not know of any Orchid which has a better appearance when grown in this way.</p>
<p><i>Oncidium concolor</i> succeeds best in a compost of peat with a little sphagnum
moss added, and with plenty of good drainage. We have grown it most successfully
in small pans, but it can be cultivated either in a basket or on a block. It would
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
succeed equally well in a pot, but the drooping character of the flower-spikes renders
it a most fitting subject for growing in either of the above-named receptacles, and
for suspension from the roof. As to temperature, we find it succeeds best in the
Odontoglossum-house during the summer months. After it has flowered, and while
it is making its growth, a copious supply of water should be given to it, always
keeping the soil moist until the growth of the bulbs is completed. When it has
finished its growth, it should be removed to the Cattleya-house, where it should be
kept moderately dry until it produces its spikes about March or April.</p>
<p>For exhibition purposes this is a most valuable little plant, being easy of
cultivation, distinct in colour, and flowering during the principal exhibition months,
May and June; its long lasting quality is also a great point in its favour. In
order to preserve the flowers for a considerable time, they should be kept free from
damp, for if allowed to get wet they soon become spotted, and fade, but when kept
in this way, they will last at least six or seven weeks. The plant is altogether a
most valuable Orchid, and as it takes up but little room, we recommend growers to
procure a good stock of it, as its effect when suspended among other flowering
Orchids is charming.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Orchids in Belgium.</span>&mdash;When in Ghent a few days ago, I had the good fortune
to receive an invitation to view the celebrated collection of Dr. Boddaert of that
city. The collection is a very extensive one, and the plants are exceedingly well
grown and healthy. There was a good show of flowering Orchids, among which
may be mentioned:&mdash;<i>Trichopilia crispa marginata</i> with forty-two expanded flowers,
a marvel of cultivation; <i>Odontoglossum Phal&aelig;nopsis</i> with twenty-six flowers, a fine
well-grown plant; <i>Cypripedium Argus</i> with six flower spikes; the new <i>Trichopilia
suavis alba</i>, of which we hope to give a plate later on; <i>Anguloa Ruckerii sanguinea</i>
with several flowers; also the rare <i>Nanodes Medus&aelig;</i>, with <i>Odontoglossums</i>, <i>Vandas</i>,
<i>Masdevallias</i>, &amp;c., in great variety.</p>

narrowed to the base, somewhat crispy at the edge, pure white, scarcely as long as
the lip; <i>lip</i> (labellum) membranaceous, three-lobed, the lateral lobes convolute around
the column, yellow outside, striped with deeper yellow veins, the middle lobe ovate,
obtuse, undulated, the anterior portion and margin white, the mouth veined with
magenta-rose, the disk naked, and the tubulose basal portion deep yellow, veined
with magenta. <i>Column</i> much shorter than the lateral lobes of the lip.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This plant belongs to that tribe of the Orchid family which is called <i>Epidendre&aelig;</i>,
and of which the genus <i>Epidendrum</i> is regarded as the type. This group
is known by its waxy pollen-masses, which are attached to a distinct caudicle, but
bear no separable stigmatic gland as occurs in the tribe <i>Vande&aelig;</i>. The genus is
closely related to <i>Cattleya</i>, and contains some of the finest ornaments of our
Orchid-houses.</p>
<p>The subject of our present illustration is a new and most beautiful Orchid,
now figured and described for the first time. It is closely allied to <i>L&aelig;lia grandis</i>,
but is distinct from that species, inasmuch as the sepals and petals are white,
whereas those of <i>L. grandis</i> are of a nankeen yellow. It is named in honour of
Baron Henry Schr&ouml;der, an enthusiastic admirer of this handsome class of plants. The
species flowered for the first time this year, in the Victoria and Paradise Nurseries.</p>
<p>The flowers are produced in May and June, three or four together, on spikes
which are produced from the apex of the new bulbs; they have a delicate and
pleasing appearance, the sepals and petals being pure white, while the lip is white,
striped with rose, throat deep yellow, veined with magenta. It should be kept
free from damp when in flower, as the blossoms being of a delicate nature, soon
spot and go off; but kept in this way free from moisture they will last about four
weeks in a fresh and perfect state.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>In growth the plant somewhat resembles <i>L. purpurata</i>, the bulbs and foliage
being about eighteen inches in height, and of a light green colour. It succeeds
well grown in the Cattleya-house in pots filled with peat and a little sphagnum
moss, over plenty of drainage. It should receive a moderate supply of water at
the root during the growing season, and should never be allowed to get thoroughly
dry. When it has made its growth it should be allowed to rest, and at that time
should be kept rather dry, only giving it sufficient water to prevent it from
shrivelling.</p>
<p><i>L&aelig;lias</i> are subject to the attacks of white scale, but this can easily be got rid
of by sponging with clean water. Thrips sometimes attack the young growths, and
if allowed to increase, soon disfigure the leaves.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cattleya gigas and C. Dowiana.</span>&mdash;These <i>Cattleyas</i> have been considered to be
shy-flowering species, and we have sometimes found them to be so in our own
experience, but we are beginning to change our opinion on this subject. No doubt
there are some plants that grow and flower more freely than others, but a great deal
depends on the conditions in which they are placed and the treatment they receive. I
recently had the pleasure of visiting the collection of W. Lee, Esq., of Leatherhead,
which in time will be one of the finest to be seen in this country. The Estate
is situated in an open part of the country, and the Orchid-houses are built on the
side of a hill where they get the full light and sun, while they are sheltered from
the driving winds; these houses are, indeed, all that can be desired, the requisitions
of the various classes of plants having been well studied. Every accommodation is
provided for those kinds, such as <i>Cattleya gigas</i> and <i>C. Dowiana</i>, that are difficult to
bloom. These two were splendidly in flower, and are most lovely and distinct kinds;
the flowers of <i>C. gigas</i> were nearly nine inches in diameter, the sepals and petals of
the purest dark rosy colour, and the lip a fine rich dark crimson magenta. <i>C.
Dowiana</i> was also very fine and attractive in colour, the sepals and petals being of
a nankeen yellow, and the lip of a rich dark purple, elegantly pencilled and striped
with lines of gold. We hope at some future time to give our readers a plate of
the fine variety of <i>C. gigas</i> above referred to. Both these species are here grown
as near the light as possible, and the treatment they receive is, first to induce a
vigorous growth, and then to give them a good rest after the growth is completed,
at the same time keeping them well exposed to the light, and giving them merely
sufficient water to prevent them from shrivelling, a more ample supply of water being
given as soon as they show signs of flowering. There was also in this collection
another species that is generally considered difficult to grow, namely, <i>Vanda teres</i>, of
which there were three plants which had been blooming very finely. When cultivated
as these are, they well repay all the trouble taken with them. These are grown at
one end of the house, without any shade.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>When <i>Cattleya Mendelii</i> was first flowered by S. Mendel, Esq., some few years
ago, many botanists were of opinion that it was not sufficiently dissimilar from, but
only a variety of, <i>C. Trian&aelig;</i>. Since that time it has been flowered in many different
collections with but little variation of character, and, as we think, has fully vindicated
its right, whether as a species or race, to be regarded as a distinct Orchid
of first-rate merit.</p>
<p>The subject of our plate is a gigantic variety of the <i>Cattleya Mendelii</i>, which
has just flowered in our own collection. It proves to be in every way larger, and
altogether superior, to the old type, the flowers having much more substance, and
being of better form, which results from the greater width of the lip and petals.
The sepals and petals are white, the latter being very broad and of good substance,
while the lip is broad and well fringed, pure white in its upper part, with a
large bright magenta patch at the front part, and the throat is orange, with
reddish crimson veins, which stand out in fine contrast against the pure white of
the remaining portions of the flower. It produces as many as four flowers on a
spike, each flower measuring over eight inches across, and the flowers are thrown
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
well up above the foliage, and thus produce the grandest appearance we have as yet
seen in any <i>Cattleya</i>.</p>
<p><i>Cattleya Mendelii</i> succeeds well in a compost of peat, with the addition of a
little sphagnum moss, and requires good drainage. We have found it to do best
in pots, with the plant well elevated above the rim, but it can be grown with
success either on a block or in a basket suspended from the roof of the house.
The temperature of the Cattleya-house suits it best.</p>
<p>This is a grand plant for exhibition or decorative purposes, as the pure white
and magenta of its flowers are exceedingly effective amongst the other species of
<i>Cattleya</i> which flower at the same time of year. The flowering season is May and
June, after which time <i>C. Mendelii</i> begins to make its growth. It should then
receive a moderate supply of water&mdash;not too much, as an over bountiful supply is
apt to cause the young growths to rot. After the annual growths are completed
the plants should be gradually dried off, only giving them sufficient water to keep
them from shrivelling.</p>
<p>The species of <i>Cattleya</i> are all subject to white scale and thrips. These insect
pests may, however, be easily removed by careful sponging, either with water or a
little insecticide; they should be cleaned off as soon as discovered, as if allowed to
establish themselves they disfigure the leaves and bulbs, and so spoil the appearance
of the plants. Cleanliness and good cultivation are the chief points to be considered
in the successful keeping of <i>Cattleyas</i>.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Vanda Lowii</span>, &amp;c.&mdash;One often hears that <i>Vanda Lowii</i> does not bloom until it
attains a large size. This, however, is erroneous, for we have flowered it when not
more than two feet high; and we have also seen a plant of about the same
size in the collection of Sir Trevor Lawrence, Bart., with a flower spike some four
or five feet long, in full beauty, with its two bright orange-yellow flowers at the base,
the rest of the blossoms being of a bright brownish-crimson colour. This was a most
extraordinary spike for so small a plant. When the specimens attain a larger size
they often produce six of these long spikes, which extend to seven feet in length.
We have one now showing this number of spikes, but the plant is fully five feet
high. We were glad to see in this collection a grand mass of <i>Epidendrum nemorale
majus</i>, which is figured in the first series of Warner&rsquo;s <i>Select Orchidaceous Plants</i>,
but we never expected to see such a specimen as that in the collection of Sir Trevor
Lawrence, which must have been three or four feet across, and had eighteen spikes of
its beautiful rosy and mauve-coloured flowers. This plant was well worth going to
see, as were many others: indeed, the fame of this collection is so widely spread
that it is almost needless to comment upon it; suffice it to say, that it is the
finest and best kept collection we know of. At the time of our visit we were
pleased to see some fine plants of <i>Cattleya superba</i> with their splendid deep rose
and crimson flowers; this is one of the most distinct and beautiful of all <i>Cattleyas</i>,
and had been grown in the East India House, suspended from the roof.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

broader than the sepals, spreading, lanceolate, acute; <i>lip</i> clawed, linear, abruptly
acute, with a bifoveate (two-holed) callosity below the middle, deep yellow passing

the lip, to which it is adnate towards the base, the anther-bed marginate in front.</p>
<p class="biblio"><span class="sc">Epidendrum vitellinum majus</span>, <i>of gardens</i>.</p>
</blockquote><hr />
<p>The original form of <i>Epidendrum vitellinum</i>, of which a good though pale-coloured
figure will be found in the <i>Botanical Register</i> for 1840 (t. 35), is one of
the most brilliant of the <i>Epidendre&aelig;</i>, on account of its remarkable fiery colour,
which makes it invaluable for contrasting with other subjects, both in the Orchid-house,
in the jardini&egrave;re, or in the bouquet. The same colour, or something near it, occurs in
a few other Orchids, which are equally valuable from a decorative point of view,
as for example in <i>L&aelig;lia cinnabarina</i>, <i>L&aelig;lia harpophylla</i>, and <i>Ada aurantiaca</i>, all
of them being plants, which, under favourable conditions, yield a brilliant effect. The
subject of our plate has the advantage of producing larger and more showy flowers
than its type, and to this extent is the more desirable of the two for the house-stage,
or exhibition table.</p>
<p>Until within the last few years this plant was very rare, but having been
imported in large quantities it is now to be found in every collection, however
limited its pretensions. The bright colour of its orange-scarlet flowers, produced in
considerable numbers on upright spikes, renders it a most striking and distinct species.
We have known the flowers to last as long as twelve weeks in perfection; in fact,
we have on several occasions exhibited a plant of it at as many as six different
successive exhibitions. Mixed with other Orchids it has a most telling effect; and a
well-flowered specimen once seen by a novice is likely to produce a lasting impression.
In the Broomfield collection it is used very largely in association with Odontoglossums,
and the effect of the orange-scarlet flowers amongst the numerous spikes
of <i>Odontoglossum Alexandr&aelig;</i>, and other species, is charming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>We have found this <i>Epidendrum</i> to do well in the Odontoglossum-house in
a compost of peat and sphagnum moss. It does equally well in a pot or in a
basket, and should receive a fair supply of water while growing. The plant seems
to revel in a good amount of sunlight, but it must be kept from the burning rays
of the sun by a slight shading, too much sunshine being apt to make the foliage
become blotched and sickly-looking.</p>
<p>The variety <i>majus</i> blooms at a different time of the year from the original
species, which has the flowers much smaller, and which blooms in August and
September from the young growths; whereas the variety <i>majus</i> flowers from the tips
of the bulbs of the previous year&rsquo;s growth. There are several forms of the plant,
some with flowers much larger and brighter than others; indeed, the one here
figured is not so large as some that were flowered years ago, which may be due to
the fact that they were old-established plants. We remember the late Mrs. Lawrence,
of Ealing Park, exhibiting a remarkably strong specimen at one of the Chiswick shows,
thirty-five years since, a perfect blaze of flower. S. Brunton, Esq., also exhibited a
grand plant of a good variety a few years back; and C. W. Lea, Esq., Parkfield,
Worcester, had a wonderful example in bloom, last year. These several plants were
all part of the early importations.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">The Manchester Show of Orchids, June, 1881.</span>&mdash;The display of Orchids at
the Manchester Exhibition was a very fine one, and no Orchid grower should have
missed the sight. The specimens were truly marvellous, especially the sixteen plants
shown by R. Dodgson, Esq., of Blackburn, amongst which were a <i>Vanda suavis</i> with
about a dozen flower-spikes; <i>L&aelig;lia purpurata</i> and <i>Cattleya Warneri</i>, both wonderful
specimens, as also was <i>Masdevallia Harryana</i>; <i>Cypripedium barbatum superbum</i>
which had a hundred blooms upon it, and was not made up for the occasion, but
had been grown on from a single plant; and <i>Dendrobium Wardianum</i> which was
a magnificent plant. Great credit is due to Mr. Osman for his talent, in successfully
cultivating so fine a collection. G. Hardy, Esq., of Timperley, exhibited some
wonderful plants, especially of <i>Cattleyas</i>, <i>L&aelig;lias</i>, <i>Dendrobium thyrsiflorum</i>, <i>Oncidium
Marshallianum</i>, <i>Odontoglossum vexillarium</i>, &amp;c. R. F. Ainsworth, Esq., M.D., also
exhibited some fine specimens, especially <i>Vanda suavis</i>, <i>A&euml;rides Fieldingii</i>, and <i>A.
Schr&ouml;derii</i>; these three are most extraordinary plants, and have been grown in the
collection for eighteen years, which is a sufficient proof of what can be done by
perseverance, and, moreover, gives one an idea how well Orchids can be grown and
exhibited for many successive years. We have known these three specimens to be
shown at the Manchester exhibitions and elsewhere for the past ten or fifteen years,
and they are now in the finest possible condition, as they have always been, under
the successful management of Mr. Mitchell. There were besides, other exhibitors
whose specimens were well worthy of note.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>Of this interesting plant, one of a popular genus inhabiting the cool temperate
humid regions of Northern and Western South America, Professor Reichenbach, by
whom it was dedicated to Mr. Shuttleworth, one of Mr. W. Bull&rsquo;s collectors, remarks
that it is &ldquo;rather a nice thing amongst <i>Masdevallias</i> of the second order of beauty.&rdquo;
It was first flowered in 1878 by W. H. Punchard, Esq., of Poulett Lodge, Twickenham.
Our figure was prepared from a plant which has bloomed in our own collection
recently. We find it to be a very free-blooming species.</p>
<p>The <i>Masdevallias</i> comprise many interesting species and varieties, some of very
remarkable structure, and others with colours of extraordinary richness and brilliancy.
Our present subject is not one of the most showy, but it may be ranked with the
more curious of the species, and is certainly of a distinct and pleasing character,
as is well represented in our Plate. The plant was discovered by Mr. Shuttleworth,
when travelling for Mr. Bull, and by him it was first transmitted to Europe. Since
then we have received it from the same country through our own collector, Mr.
Carder. The <i>Masdevallias</i> are plentiful in their native habitats, but the difficulty of
obtaining them in this country lies in the risks attending importation, which are
mainly attributable to the fact that they have no thick fleshy bulbs to support them
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
during their journey. We have heard of thousands of plants of this particular species
having been sent off, but of these comparatively few have been received alive, so that
unless some more successful means of introducing them into England can be found,
it will always remain a rare plant.</p>
<p><i>Masdevallia Shuttleworthii</i> is of free-blooming habit, and the flowers last a long
time in perfection. It generally blossoms during the spring and summer months.
The plants require but little room, as the foliage is of neat growth, and the whole
height of the plant does not exceed from six to eight inches. The leaves are of a
dark green colour and firm texture. The flower-scapes proceed from the young growth,
and attain the height of about eight inches, the more conspicuous spreading long-tailed
sepals being of a pleasing yellowish rose colour thickly marked with wine-red
spots, while the petals and lip are small and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>We find the plants grow well when potted in small pots or pans suspended from
the roof, and filled with peat and sphagnum moss; but they require thorough drainage,
since they need a liberal supply of water during summer. In the autumn and
winter months they do not require so full a supply, but they must have sufficient
to keep them moist. They thrive best in the same house with the <i>Odontoglots</i>,
where they obtain shade, and are kept cool. None of the <i>Masdevallias</i> like heat,
and most of them require the same kind of treatment. The house in which they
are grown should have a north aspect, so that they may not get too much sun-heat,
as this causes the leaves to become spotted, to the great disfigurement of the plant.</p>
<p>Insects become a nuisance if allowed to accumulate on the plants. The thrips,
which is one of their greatest insect enemies, constantly attacks them, and must be
subdued by cleansing them frequently and thoroughly with a sponge and warm
soft water.</p>
<p>The propagation of <i>Masdevallias</i> is effected by dividing the plants, leaving a few
old bulbs with a leading one in front. They are the easiest of all Orchids to
increase, and are best divided up occasionally, as when the plants get too large
they do not flower so freely. The most suitable time to perform this operation is
just as they commence to make their growth. They should at first be put into
small pots, and shifted into larger ones as they increase in size, and develope abundance
of roots.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">L&aelig;lia Philbrickiana.</span>&mdash;This new Hybrid was exhibited at the Royal Horticultural
Society, South Kensington, by the Messrs. Veitch and Sons. It was raised
between <i>Cattleya Aclandi&aelig;</i> and <i>L&aelig;lia elegans</i>, partaking of the dwarf habit of
<i>C. Aclandi&aelig;</i>. The plant grows about eight inches high, and produces its leaves in
pairs, of a dark green colour, about four inches in length; from between these the
flower-sheaths proceed. The sepals and petals are of a glossy purplish crimson-brown,
spotted with darker spots; the lip is of a bright crimson, the basal part
purple and white. It blooms in June and July, and will be a very useful addition
to our collections.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>One of the most chaste and charming of the summer-flowering <i>Cattleyas</i>, and
quite distinct in aspect from all others in cultivation. We have great pleasure in
dedicating it to Mrs. M. Morgan, of New York, who is a great admirer of this noble
class of Orchidaceous plants, and, moreover, has a fine and valuable collection of
them. The first specimen we bloomed produced ten flower spikes, and was exhibited
at the Manchester Botanical and Horticultural Society&rsquo;s Show in June, 1879; the
plant was the admiration of all who saw it, and was on that occasion awarded a
First Class Certificate on account of its distinct and pleasing character.</p>
<p><i>Cattleya Morgan&aelig;</i> belongs to the same section of the genus as <i>C. Mendelii</i>,
of which section there are many races or varieties, all of which are beautiful and
rich in the colouring of the lip, some having the sepals and petals white, while
in others they are of a rosy hue, more or less intense. The plant now before us
grows about eighteen inches in height, and has light green foliage with a somewhat
drooping habit. It produces its flowers freely, as many as four together on the
spike. The sepals and petals are pure white; and the lip is white with a light
magenta blotch near the apex, its throat orange colour, the incurved base white,
and the edge beautifully fringed. The flowers are produced in May and June,
and last from five to six weeks in perfection. It makes a fine subject for decorative
purposes, since its pure white flowers form a charming contrast with the high-coloured
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
varieties of other species of <i>Cattleya</i>, of which there are many that come
into bloom at about the same time.</p>
<p><i>Cattleya Morgan&aelig;</i> requires the same treatment as <i>C. Mendelii</i> and <i>C. Mossi&aelig;</i>,
and will thrive well, grown either in a pot or basket, planted in good fibrous peat
and sphagnum moss. It will also succeed on a block suspended from the roof. As
in the case of the other <i>Cattleyas</i>, it prefers to have all the light possible, but to be
just sufficiently shaded to keep off the direct rays of the sun. It must be borne
in mind that the plants are found growing naturally on the branches and stems of
trees in the forests, where they get some shade, and a free circulation of air,
which it is of great benefit to secure, and which should be made a point of
the utmost importance in the artificial cultivation of all Orchids, as of most other
plants. It would be a great boon to cultivators if our collectors would note down
and supply fuller and more precise information on these points, for although of course
the natural conditions could not in all cases be carried out to the full extent, yet
we should then be better able to imitate them, and thus supply the natural wants
of the plants. In giving as much air and light as possible, however, cold draughts
must be avoided, which may be effected by fixing the ventilators near the hot-water
pipes, and should a cold wind prevail by giving air on the opposite side,
always closing the house in good time. In summer water should be freely
sprinkled about the tables and paths twice a day, namely, in the morning, and
about three or four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. During the dull dark days of winter,
very little moisture is required, but on warm days some water may be given to
the plants, especially in springtime when the days begin to lengthen. Syringing
should be avoided during the winter, except in the case of those on blocks, for
a little dewing with the syringe during the day, will not hurt these, as the moisture
quickly dries off. The water should always be used in a tepid state.</p>
<p>One of the most important items in Orchid culture is cleanliness. Every plant
should be cleansed as soon as any indications of insect life are perceived upon it,
since there are Insecticides and other remedies sold to destroy all such pests.
Cockroaches, Snails, and Woodlice are very troublesome, and should be well looked
after at night when they come out to feed on the young shoots and flowers.
Woodlice may be caught by laying down here and there traps, consisting of some
moss, at night, or half potatos or turnips scooped out in the centre, and placed
about in quiet nooks and corners, or on the pots; the woodlice will harbour under
them, and may be caught and destroyed in the morning.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p><i>Promen&aelig;a</i> is a small genus of Orchids which was separated from <i>Maxillaria</i>
about forty years ago (1843) by Lindley, who at the same time also dissociated
from it the plants respectively referred to <i>Warrea</i>, <i>Paphinia</i>, <i>Lycaste</i>, and <i>Scuticaria</i>.
Later on Reichenbach classed <i>Promen&aelig;a</i> as a section of <i>Zygopetalum</i>. Dr. Lindley
distinguished the group of species which he referred to <i>Promen&aelig;a</i>, and which he
regarded as fully entitled to generic rank, by the following peculiar features,
namely, their spreading sepals, their three-lobed lip, crested or tuberculate at the
base, their short semi-terete column, and their ovate glandule with four, that is
two double, sessile pollen masses. The species then proposed were <i>P. stapelioides</i>,
<i>P. xanthina</i>, <i>P. lentiginosa</i>, <i>P. Rollissonii</i>, and <i>P. graminea</i>. To these Reichenbach
added <i>P. guttata</i> in 1856, and <i>P. microptera</i> in 1881. Neither of these
authorities, so far as we can trace, refer to <i>P. citrina</i>; but, according to Don and
Loudon, the plant was introduced to our gardens in 1840, though they attribute
to it the erroneous habitat of Mexico. Our good friend, Professor Reichenbach,
suggests that it is a garden name, sometimes applied to <i>P. Rollissonii</i> and sometimes
to <i>P. guttata</i>; but it has long been recognised as a distinct plant by English and
Continental Orchid growers, and is certainly different from the <i>P. Rollissonii</i> figured
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
by Dr. Lindley; nor does it correspond with the description of <i>P. guttata</i>, so far
as the materials at hand enable us to judge.</p>
<p>This, it will be seen, is a very neat-growing plant, the small tetragonal pseudobulbs
slowly creeping over the surface of the blocks on which the plants are grown.
It is, moreover, of small stature, the leaves, which grow in pairs from the top of
the pseudobulbs, rarely exceeding three or four inches in height, and the flower-scapes
attaining even less elevation. The flowers, which are rather large for so small
a plant, being of a rich and brilliant colour, become rather effective; and though,
of course, they do not compare at all in gorgeous beauty with those of many of
the larger-flowered Orchids, they are by no means to be despised even from the
decorative point of View; indeed, when grown on a block, as represented in the
accompanying Plate, and suspended from the roof of the house, the plant forms a
very pretty and distinct object, occupying, as it does, but a small space in which
it displays much beauty and attractiveness. The bright orange-yellow flowers are,
moreover, very freely produced, and if kept dry, continue for a long time in a fresh
and pleasing condition.</p>
<p>There is another species of the same habit, <i>Promen&aelig;a stapelioides</i>, which comes
into bloom about the same time as this, and in which the flowers are spotted with
dark purple, so that they appear to be nearly black. The contrast of these two
when grown and flowered on the same block is very effective. In the noble collection
of Sir Trevor Lawrence, Bart., M.P., we saw a large pan-full of <i>P. citrina</i> growing
freely, which had a very beautiful appearance, but we prefer to see the plant grown
on a block, as in this manner the flowers hang downwards, and are shown off to
much greater advantage. There are certain varieties to be occasionally met with,
in which the flowers are without spots on the lip, but those which have this
latter peculiarity are to be preferred, as the two colours afford a pleasant relief.</p>
<p>Fibrous peat and sphagnum moss seem to suit the plant well when it is grown
in either pots or pans; but when cultivated on blocks of wood, a little sphagnum
moss only about its roots will be quite sufficient, though if grown in this latter
way it requires a more liberal and more frequent supply of water, in order to
keep the roots moist. We find the Cattleya-house to suit it best, and we grow
it suspended against a wall at the end of the house, where it gets syringed in warm
weather. The manner in which its blooms are produced may be seen from our
Illustration, which is an excellent representation of the habit of the plant, not only
as regards its general manner of growth, but also of its mode of flowering.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This magnificent plant is one of the most beautiful species of the genus
<i>Cypripedium</i>. Several varieties of it are known, and though they are all good and
well worth growing, that which we have selected for illustration is the best and
darkest that has come under our notice. The plant from which our figure was
taken, bloomed in the Victoria Nursery, and had five flower-spikes, two of which
have been in bloom for the past six weeks, and are now as fresh as ever.</p>
<p><i>Cypripedium Stonei</i> was first flowered by Mr. Stone, gardener to John Day, Esq.,
of High Cross, Tottenham, after whom it has been named. It was for a long
period a very rare species, and, indeed now, though small plants may be purchased
for a moderate sum, yet large specimens are scarce and valuable. It makes a fine
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
show plant, its lasting qualities being a great recommendation to it, both from an
exhibition and decorative point of view.</p>
<p>The plant is a native of Borneo, and was introduced to this country by the
Messrs. Low, of Clapton. It produces dark green foliage of about twelve or in some
of the varieties we have seen as much as fifteen inches in length. From the
centre of this tuft of leaves the flower-spikes are produced and rise to a height of
about two feet, each bearing three or four of its large slipper-shaped blossoms,
which are the most exact representations of a shoe or slipper of those of any of
the species, and most completely justify the trivial name of the genus, Lady&rsquo;s
Slipper. The sepals are large, white, striped on the veins or nerves, with dark
purple, and tinged with yellow; the petals are five inches in length, and are yellowish,
streaked and blotched with purple; and the lip is large and of a dull reddish-purple,
veined with deeper purple-red. It is of free-blooming habit, and when the
growths are strong it produces a flower-spike from each crown, but it takes some
considerable time to complete its growth before it sends forth its spikes; indeed, it
begins to grow soon after its blossoms have faded. The plant having no thick
fleshy bulbs from which to derive support, requires a more continuous supply of moisture
than many other Orchids. The roots are coarse and fleshy, and should in consequence
be supplied with a stronger soil than is required by some of the other kinds. We
find it to thrive best in good fibrous loam, with a small quantity of charcoal, and
a little leaf-mould or peat, all being well mixed together, giving the pots good
drainage, but not so much as is required in the case of <i>Cattleyas</i>, for example.
As it is a strong rooting plant, it is best grown in a pot, and should be a little
elevated above the rim. We have found the East India house to supply the most
suitable atmospheric conditions in which to cultivate it; here it should be placed on
the side-tables near the light, but out of the sun. The finest specimen we have seen
exhibited was staged by Mr. Child, gardener to Mrs. Torr, Garbrand Hall, Ewell,
Surrey, at the South Kensington Show, in 1878.</p>
<p>There is a very distinct variety of this plant called <i>Cypripedium Stonei
platyt&aelig;nium</i>, of which a figure has been lately published in Mr. Warner&rsquo;s <i>Select
Orchidaceous Plants</i>, 3 ser., t. 16. Of this form, living plants were till recently only
to be found in the collection of John Day, Esq., but they were distributed when that
collection was recently dispersed by auction sales, and were purchased at high prices
by Baron Schr&ouml;der and Sir Trevor Lawrence, Bart., M.P., in whose collections they
may now be seen. This variety is just like <i>C. Stonei</i> in its growth, and the
flowers are closely similar, the chief difference being, that the petals are shorter and
broader, and resemble those of <i>C. superbiens</i>.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>The species, of which this is one of the finest known varieties, and the genus
<i>L&aelig;lia</i> to which it belongs, together with the neighbouring genus <i>Cattleya</i>, are placed
by the great Orchidist, Reichenbach, in his amplified genus <i>Bletia</i>, so that the <i>L&aelig;lia
purpurata</i> of Lindley, in <i>Paxton&rsquo;s Flower Garden</i>, becomes the <i>Bletia purpurata</i> of
Reichenbach in <i>Walpers&rsquo; Annales</i>, vi. 423. The name of <i>L&aelig;lia</i> is, however, that
which is adopted amongst cultivators of Orchids.</p>
<p>The <i>L&aelig;lia</i> which we have now to describe, was named many years ago in the
<i>Orchid Grower&rsquo;s Manual</i>, when it was exhibited at the Crystal Palace and received
its present appellation. The plant now represented was flowered at the Victoria and
Paradise Nurseries, but has now passed into the select collection of Baron Schr&ouml;der,
of The Dell, near Staines. It was a wonderfully strong plant, and produced two
spikes of its highly coloured blossoms, which led all those who saw it in its beauty,
to pronounce it to be the finest <i>L&aelig;lia</i> they had ever witnessed. Our artist has
given a good representation of the plant and its blossoms. The club-shaped stems
and foliage stood thirty inches in height, and were provided with very strong
sheathing bracts whence the flower-spikes issued, each bearing four flowers, which
were individually eight inches in diameter. It has bloomed with us in the same
style for two successive years. The plant that we flowered some years ago was
not so large as that now figured, the reason being that it was not so strong a
specimen, and, therefore, not able to produce such fine flowers. This is sufficient
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
evidence of the advance the plants make before they get to their full strength and
vigour. In the variety before us the sepals and petals are of a delicate rose,
veined with a beautiful dark tint of the same colour, while the lip is very broad,
large, and splendidly coloured, the prominent parts of a rich dark crimson-magenta,
paler and veiny at the tip, and beautifully veined with crimson on the yellow
ground-colour of the throat. The blooming season is in May and June, the flowers
continuing in perfection for three or four weeks, if kept free from damp and in a
dry place. We have a house set aside specially for Orchids when in flower, and
in it very little moisture is used, by which means we seldom get the flowers
spotted or prematurely decayed.</p>
<p>There is another fine form of <i>L&aelig;lia purpurata</i> with white sepals and petals
that are quite flat, not at all recurved; this variety has a rich dark crimson-magenta
lip. We exhibited this form with nine flower spikes at the Regent&rsquo;s Park
Exhibition, and it produced a grand effect. There are many other fine varieties.</p>
<p><i>L&aelig;lia purpurata</i> when well cultivated is a good looking plant, and even when
not in bloom it is an object of attraction, on account of its stately evergreen foliage.
It is a native of Brazil, and is found growing on the branches of trees on the outskirts
of the forests where the plants get light, and are yet shaded from the burning
sun. They are best grown in the Cattleya-house, and will thrive either in pots or
baskets, but we find the pot system the best, as they are strong growing plants,
and require ample space to bring them to perfection. They are the better for being
moved about, especially if they are required for exhibition. There are no more
showy Orchids for exhibition purposes, and this is especially true of such varieties
as that now before us.</p>
<p>We find that they thrive best in good fibrous peat, and some live sphagnum
moss on a part of the surface; when in a growing state the moss keeps them moist
without too much water being given whilst they are making their growth. In
watering them be careful not to wet the young shoots. The pots should be three
parts filled with drainage, which must be formed of broken pots and lumps of charcoal
intermixed. The plants must be elevated about two inches above the rim of the
pot. The best time to pot them is after they have done blooming just as they
begin to make new growths, and before the roots start, when they will soon commence
to work into the clean sweet peat. If the plant is in a sufficiently large pot, and
the soil about it is sweet and clean, it will not require re-potting, but it will
benefit the plants greatly to give them some fresh fibrous peat just before they
begin to root, as the old soil is apt to become hard and inert through constant
watering. They require to be kept moist during the growing season, but must not
even then be soddened with water. In winter only just sufficient must be given
them to keep them moist, and to prevent their stems and leaves from shriveling.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>The genus <i>Phal&aelig;nopsis</i> belongs to the tribe <i>Vande&aelig;</i>, which is distinguished
amongst those with waxy pollen-masses, by having these attached to a distinct
caudicle, united to a deciduous stigmatic gland. It no doubt comprises several of
our finest Orchids, which are prized no less on account of the graceful development
of their inflorescence than for the attractive white blossoms of the more familiar
species. Our drawing of the charming <i>Phal&aelig;nopsis amabilis Dayana</i> here figured, was
taken from a fine specimen in the collection of W. Lee, Esq., of Downside, Leatherhead,
who was kind enough to allow us to publish an illustration of it. The variety
is very rare; indeed, we believe this is the only specimen known to be in cultivation
in this country. It was named in compliment to John Day, Esq., of Tottenham,
from whose collection it was obtained by Mr. Lee. From the markings about the
base of the lip it will be seen to be very distinct, though it is no doubt a form
of <i>P. amabilis</i>, with which it agrees in foliage and in the general character of the
flowers, but differs in the distinct markings just referred to. The plant grows to
about the same size as <i>P. amabilis</i>.</p>
<p>There is at Downside a grand collection of <i>Phal&aelig;nopsids</i>, which are especially
well managed by Mr. Woolford, the gardener. They are great favourites with Mr.
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Lee, and he has built a house to meet their special wants. This is undoubtedly a
good plan to adopt where there is such a fine and comprehensive set of plants as
are to be found in this establishment, since they require different treatment to most
other Orchids. They have thick fleshy leaves, and the stems of the plant are also
fleshy, while, unlike many Orchids, they have no thick pseudobulbs from which to
derive support; hence it follows that they require more moisture than many others.
We do not, however, agree with giving them so much as we often see supplied.
One great advantage of having a separate house for them is that their individual
treatment and wants can be more carefully studied and more exactly met.</p>
<p>We have seen <i>Phal&aelig;nopsids</i> grown well amongst other East Indian Orchids. For
instance, we exhibited a plant so grown of <i>Phal&aelig;nopsis grandiflora</i> for ten successive
years at the Chiswick and Regent&rsquo;s Park Exhibitions, and at several shows during
each year, and it generally bore from sixty to seventy blossoms. This was the
variety imported from Java, which we consider the best, as it produces more flowers
than the variety from Borneo. We see that growers now-a-days are obliged to put
several plants together in order to make a specimen fit for exhibition. There were
others who about that time also exhibited these large plants, and, amongst them
Mr. Kinghorn showed at Chiswick a wonderful specimen, bearing the best flower-spike
we have ever seen.</p>
<p><i>Phal&aelig;nopsis amabilis Dayana</i> requires the same treatment as <i>P. grandiflora</i> and
<i>P. amabilis</i>, and will do either in a pot, basket, or pan, suspended from the roof.
It will also thrive on the side stages, but in this case requires to be elevated
so that the roots can hang free, for they are abundant rooting plants. If
suspended from the roof the plants have more room to throw out their thick fleshy
roots, and in this way they approach nearer to the manner in which they grow
in their native habitats, for they are found on the branches and stems of trees,
where they obtain a free circulation of air. When thus suspended they get without
restraint the fresh air that circulates through the house. They can also be cultivated
on blocks, but under these circumstances they will require to be more freely supplied
with moisture. These are plants that like plenty of light, but they must be shielded
from the sun by shading. The best material to grow them in is sphagnum moss,
with good drainage, and they require to be kept moist all the year round. In warm
weather they of course require more than in winter, when just a sufficient quantity
to keep the moss in a moist condition will be all that they will need. It is
imperative never to allow water to reach the heart of the plant, for that will
sometimes induce it to rot, and will often cause the leaves to go spotted.</p>
<p>The plants must, of necessity, be kept free from insects. Sometimes the thrips
will attack them, but this should be cleaned off. To be thoroughly successful with
Orchids they require constant watching. Cockroaches are a great pest to all those
that throw out thick fleshy roots, which they injure by gnawing them off, thereby
weakening the constitution of the plant. J. S. Bockett, Esq., of Stamford Hill, has
one of the finest grown collections of <i>Phal&aelig;nopsis</i> we have ever seen, but this, of
course, has been in process of formation for years, and the plants have become

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This charming Orchid is very nearly related to <i>Oncidium curtum</i>, <i>O. pr&aelig;textum</i>,
and <i>O. amictum</i>. It belongs to an extensive genus of Vandeous Orchids, many of
the species of which are exceedingly beautiful on account of the brilliancy of their
flowers, which are mostly of a bright yellow colour, often prettily spotted, and
generally produced in graceful spikes or panicles. No collection should be without
some of the best and most ornamental of them. The figure which we now publish
represents a very charming Brazilian species, one of the best forms of the plant we
have seen. Our drawing was made from a specimen in the select and varied
collection of W. Vanner, Esq., of Chislehurst, who was kind enough to permit our
artist to avail himself of it. This collection occupies several houses which are
respectively filled with species belonging to the different groups or classes, and
among which are some very rare specimens, all well cultivated by Mr. Milford,
the gardener, who, for many years has been a successful grower of Orchids.</p>
<p><i>Oncidium Gardneri</i> is a compact growing plant, furnished with dark green
pseudobulbs, which are from two to three inches in height. The foliage is also dark
green in colour, and about six inches in length. The flowers are very freely produced
in branching spikes or panicles, and are generally developed in June and July,
lasting for several weeks in perfection. The sepals and petals are brown, narrowly
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
margined with pale yellow. The lip is large, of a bright golden-yellow colour,
margined with bright brown oblong parallel blotches. The flowers, moreover, are
deliciously scented. There are many varieties of this plant, all of which are worth
growing, since they take up but little space, and when grown in quantity, produce
a good effect. We saw about fifty spikes of the different varieties, some in bloom,
and others showing, in the collection of C. G. Hill, Esq., of Arnot Hill, near
Nottingham, and we shall not soon forget the effect produced, as the group of plants
appeared to be one mass of bloom. By cultivating plants of this character space may
be economised, since they grow as freely on blocks as in baskets. We also find
them to thrive well in small pans suspended from the roof of the Cattleya-house or in
any situation affording them the same temperature, with very slight shading from the
sun. They are best grown near the glass, so that they may get all the light possible.
As a root medium, a mixture of good sphagnum moss and fibrous peat suits them best,
but the plants must have good drainage, since they must be kept moist during the
growing season, though when at rest a more limited supply will suffice&mdash;just sufficient
being given to keep the bulbs plump, for on the other hand, it is not a plant that
likes to be dried up. The bulbs sometimes shrivel when they flower too freely;
if this is observed do not allow the blossoms to remain too long on the plants,
as they will keep a good time in water when cut from the plant. Being of a
graceful character they are well adapted for the decoration of drawing-room stands,
in which, if intermixed with foliage and other flowers, they help to produce a very
charming effect. Indeed no flowers are so useful as Orchids for decorative purposes,
as they last so long when cut.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">L&aelig;lia Dominiana rosea.</span>&mdash;This is the finest hybrid <i>L&aelig;lia</i> that has come under
our notice. It is the result of a cross between <i>Cattleya Dowiana</i>, and <i>C. exoniensis</i>,
and the parentage is very evident in the novel form thus obtained. The lip is
like that of <i>C. Dowiana</i>, of a rich purple-crimson, crisped at the margin; the
sepals and petals are of a pale lilac colour. It is a most beautiful <i>L&aelig;lia</i>, and is
named in honour of Mr. Dominy, who has been most successful in raising seedling
Orchids. There have been many wonderful hybrids brought out by the Messrs.
Veitch and Sons, through the indefatigable exertions of Mr. Dominy, who has long
been known as one of the oldest and most successful of Orchid growers, and whose
name will be kept in remembrance as long as Orchids are cultivated.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This fine Dendrobe, of which Reichenbach remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;I believe it is one of the
best <i>Dendrobia</i> ever imported,&rdquo; was introduced in 1873 by Mr. Low, of Clapton,
as recorded in the <i>Gardeners&rsquo; Chronicle</i> for 1874 (<span class="small">N.S.</span>, i. 406), where it was first
described. It is again referred to in the same publication in 1876 (<span class="small">N.S.</span>, v. 756),
where the German Professor remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;The species stands indeed, as has been
stated before, close to <i>Dendrobium chrysotoxum</i>. The flowers are smaller, the fringe
is made by much shorter papill&aelig;, the chin is shorter, the petals are narrower, the
lip does not expand to an open mass, but its lateral parts keep bent over the base,
thus forming a cucullate body so as to allow the beautiful dark blackish spot to be
seen, and which contrasts so well with the deep yellow of the flower. There are
also a few blackish streaks on each side of the base of the lip.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Dendrobium suavissimum</i> is one of the most beautiful species of the yellow-flowered
section of this vast genus, and one that is much admired and sought after
by Orchid growers. The accompanying plate is a good representation of the plant,
and from this it will be seen that it is one of the most attractive of summer-flowering
Orchids. Our sketch was taken from a specimen exhibited by us during
the present year, at the Royal Botanic Society&rsquo;s Garden in the Regent&rsquo;s Park.</p>
<p>Formerly this was a very rare plant, but within the last few years it has been
sent home in considerable quantities by collectors, and it has in consequence become
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
comparatively cheap. In growth it resembles <i>Dendrobium chrysotoxum</i>, but the flowers
are much more showy; in <i>D. chrysotoxum</i> they are wholly yellow, whereas in this
species there is a large sanguineous purple blotch on the lip, forming a striking
contrast to the rich golden yellow of the sepals and petals; in addition to this
they are sweet-scented. The plant is of free-flowering habit, and when well-grown
produces finely-developed flower-spikes. We have seen as many as three spikes
proceeding from a single stem.</p>
<p>In habit of growth <i>Dendrobium suavissimum</i> is very compact. The stems or
pseudobulbs are about a foot in height, and furnished with one or two pairs of
dark green leaves at the apex. The flower-spikes proceed from the tops of the two-year-old
bulbs, and average from ten to twelve inches in length. The stems will
sometimes produce spikes for several years in succession. The flowers last from two
to three weeks in perfection if kept from damp.</p>
<p>Like other Dendrobiums, this species is found growing on the trunks and branches
of trees in positions where it gets plenty of light and air. With us it thrives well
grown in a basket suspended near the roof, so as to obtain all the light and air
possible; the bulbs thus become well matured. The best material for growing it in
is sound sweet fibrous peat, with a good supply of drainage. The plants should be
watered liberally at the roots during the period of growth, which is after they have
done blooming. The temperature that suits them best is that of the East India-house
while they are making their growth; but when the growth is completed very
little water should be given them until they begin to show their spikes in spring,
when it may be increased, as it will assist them to produce stronger spikes. The
plant is propagated by division; two or more old bulbs should be taken off with
a young growth in front. Insects should be well looked after, and when found be
speedily removed.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This plant belongs to a small genus of Vandeous Orchids, some of the species
of which are exceedingly pretty, and well worthy of a place in every collection.
Dr. Lindley calls <i>Trichopilia suavis</i> &ldquo;a delicious Orchid,&rdquo; and says that &ldquo;the flowers
emit the most delicate odour of hawthorn.&rdquo; The fragrant and richly spotted flowers
make it a great favourite amongst growers, and no doubt it is one of the best
and most showy of the species yet known. The variety <i>alba</i>, of which we have
now the pleasure of publishing an authentic figure, the first which has appeared, is
new to cultivation, and is also extremely rare. Our plate was prepared from a
specimen which flowered in the fine collection of Dr. G. Boddaert, of Ghent, Belgium,
who kindly allowed us to have a drawing made from it.</p>
<p><i>Trichopilia suavis alba</i> was imported, with the typical <i>T. suavis</i>, and is a
compact evergreen plant, with foliage attaining from six to ten inches in height, and
three inches in width, and of a light green colour. The pendent flower-scapes are
produced from the base of the bulbs, and bear two or three, or sometimes four,
flowers, which thus hang over the sides of the pan or basket in which the plant
is cultivated. When suspended from the roof of the house they thus have a very
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
charming appearance. The sepals and petals are pure white; the lip is white, with
a pale yellow stain in the throat. The plant blossoms during May and June, and
lasts about two weeks in perfection. We have flowered this variety during the
present year, and it was very much admired by every one who saw it.</p>
<p><i>Trichopilia suavis alba</i> was exhibited by J. S. Bockett, Esq., of Stamford Hill,
at one of the meetings of the Royal Horticultural Society, and was awarded a
First Class Certificate of Merit.</p>
<p>The Cattleya house is the best position for the plant, but it should be placed
at the coolest end. It will flourish either in a basket or pot, in a compost of
fibrous peat, with good drainage, but it must be well elevated above the rim, so
that the flowers may hang down according to their natural habit. Propagation is
effected by division of the plant after blooming; two or three bulbs should be
severed from the original plant, or more if a larger specimen is desired.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">A&euml;rides odoratum majus.</span>&mdash;This fine old Orchid was shown by Mrs. Arbuthnot
at the Chislehurst Exhibition, on the 16th of July, and in this case it was a most
wonderful example of good cultivation. The plant was one mass of its beautiful
racemes of flowers, about fifty in number, many of them measuring fifteen inches
in length. The flowers are white, tipped with pink, and are produced in long
graceful spikes which overhang the foliage and produce a most charming effect.
The perfume given off by this variety is very delightful, and was in this case
most refreshing to those who passed by, many of whom wondered where the pleasant
odour came from, as it was shown among the stove and greenhouse plants. This
plant was two and a half feet in diameter, and three feet in height. Great credit is
due to Mr. Mitchell, the gardener, for his skill in cultivating so fine a specimen.
We often wonder why this plant is not more popular at our exhibitions, especially
as it is easy to grow, taking very few years to make a good specimen, and being
purchasable in small sizes for a few shillings. When not in bloom, it is, moreover,
an attractive plant.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This glorious thing, as Professor Reichenbach calls it, was first discovered by
the Rev. C. Parish in 1862, and then lost sight of, but was rediscovered in 1870,
from which discovery, we presume, the first plants were obtained by Mr. S. Low, of
the Clapton Nursery; since then we have received living plants of it on several
occasions, and the plant now figured was from one of these importations. It is a
small and distinct growing <i>Vanda</i>, and is well worthy of a place in every collection
on account of its compact habit of growth, which resembles that of a <i>Phal&aelig;nopsis</i>.
The Vandas are for the most part large growers, but, as will be seen from the
accompanying figure, <i>Vanda Parishii</i> is an exception to the general rule. Our
plate was prepared from a plant which bloomed in the collection of the Right Hon.
J. Chamberlain, M.P., of Birmingham&mdash;a gentleman who is making a grand collection
of Orchids, and is a great admirer of them. The plant above referred to was a
well-grown specimen, bearing a good spike of flowers.</p>
<p>The leaves are about eight inches in length by four inches in breadth, and of
a lively green colour; and the flower-spike reaches from ten to twelve inches in
length, the flowers being as large as those of <i>Vanda gigantea</i> and <i>V. lissochiloides</i>.
The sepals and petals are greenish-yellow, freely spotted with reddish-brown; the
base of the lip, which is keeled, is white, the front lobe violet-mauve, faintly
margined with white. Altogether it is a very distinct species, and is very strongly
scented, with a peculiar odour; it lasts for several weeks in bloom.</p>
<p><i>Vanda Parishii</i> requires about the same treatment as other Vandas, and should
be grown in the East India-house, in sphagnum moss, with plenty of drainage. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
would appear never to attain more than about a foot in height, being unusually
short and stout in growth. It is best grown in a basket or pot suspended from
the roof, and should be well shaded from the sun. It revels in a good supply of
water during the growing period, which extends over summer and autumn; but in
winter only just sufficient water should be given to keep the moss damp, for if
allowed to become over-dry it will shrivel, having no pseudobulbs to support it.
Thrips and scale are sometimes found on this plant; these should be diligently
searched for and destroyed, as the leaves, being of a fleshy nature, would otherwise
soon become disfigured by the onslaught of these pests.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Orchids at Arnot Hill.</span>&mdash;We append a few notes on the Orchids at Arnot
Hill, near Nottingham, the residence of C. G. Hill, Esq., a gentleman who is forming
a fine collection of these plants, and one which we have no doubt will in time
take a foremost rank, as Mr. Hill is specially fond of good Orchids, and intends to
grow only those which are most worthy of cultivation. There is a fine range of
houses built to suit the cool, the intermediate, and the East Indian kinds, and the
arrangements are all that can be desired, having been made the chief study. Of the
genus <i>Odontoglossum</i>, we found at the time of our visit, some few months since, there
was a large collection, including some hundreds of plants of <i>O. Alexandr&aelig;</i> and
<i>O. Pescatorei</i>, amongst which were many fine specimens. There was also a fine lot of
Masdevallias; the Bull&rsquo;s-blood variety of <i>M. Harryana</i> was in splendid condition,
and there were many other fine varieties. We noticed a house full of <i>Oncidium
Gardneri</i> mixed with <i>O. pr&aelig;textum</i> and <i>O. curtum</i>, the plants bearing about fifty
spikes, the greater part of which were in bloom, the flowers deliciously fragrant, and
presenting a beautiful picture, as the bright yellow lip with its definite margin of
brown shows off the flowers to great advantage. In the Cattleya house there were
many fine plants which were rooting and growing well. We noticed a good specimen
plant of the new <i>Cattleya Trian&aelig; Russelliana</i>, also of the rare <i>C. exoniensis</i>, of
the beautiful <i>C. Reineckiana</i>, of the best variety of <i>C. labiata</i> showing flower-sheaths,
and many others. <i>Oncidium incurvum</i> was beautifully in bloom, and with its snow-white
lip had a very pretty appearance.</p>
<p>In the next house we noticed three good plants of <i>Dendrochilum filiforme</i> finely
in flower; one plant had fifty of its graceful spikes of yellow blossoms hanging among
the foliage, and the other two plants were equally good.</p>
<p>In the adjoining house there were many fine East Indian Orchids. We noticed
four plants of the rare <i>A&euml;rides Schr&ouml;deri</i>, and a wonderful variety of <i>A. Lobbii</i> in
full bloom, with a fine branching spike&mdash;one of the best we have seen, and one
of which we hope at some future time to furnish our readers with a figure.
There was a good collection of East Indian Orchids being got together, and from
the appearance and health of the young stock they seemed likely to thrive well.
We were glad to see this class of Orchids so well appreciated, as there can be no
doubt that the East Indian kinds are among the richest and finest of the family,
and they will flourish in a lower temperature than most people imagine.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This noble plant is remarkable for the large mass of richly-coloured flagrant
blossoms which terminates the flower-scape, and is very much superior to the old
<i>Cattleya guttata</i>, which was introduced to our collections some fifty years ago, and
of which a fine figure was published in the <i>Transactions of the Horticultural Society</i>,
ix. t. 8. The variety <i>Leopoldii</i> differs from the type, in its much larger flowers,
and in the rich olive or reddish-brown colour of its sepals and petals, which are
freely spotted with dark crimson. <i>C. guttata Leopoldii</i> is, moreover, of much more
recent introduction than the type, having been imported to the gardens of Belgium
by M. Ambroise Verschaffelt, through his collector, M. Devos, in 1850. It was by
him dedicated to his Majesty the late King of the Belgians. As will be seen from
our illustration, it is a very great improvement on the typical form. We are indebted
to H. Shaw, Esq., of Buxton, for the opportunity of securing our figure, the plant
having flowered in his choice and valuable collection during the month of August
in the present year, producing a spike of eleven fine flowers, each measuring three
inches in diameter. This must be regarded as a very valuable Orchid, since it
blossoms during the late summer months, when flowers are comparatively scarce in
our Orchid houses; while for exhibition purposes, again, it is of great value.</p>
<p>The plant now before us is a strong grower, like <i>Cattleya guttata</i>, and sometimes
produces as many as thirty flowers in a spike. A plant bearing a spike of this
noble character was exhibited some years ago by Mr. Page, then gardener to the late
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
W. Leaf, Esq., of Streatham, and was a most wonderful object. The stems grow
from twenty to thirty inches in height, and are furnished at the apex with a pair
of broad leathery leaves of a dark green colour. It produces its flowers from the
top of the bulb after it has finished its growth. The sepals and petals are of a
lively cinnamon-brown, spotted with rich deep crimson; while the lip is of a bright
magenta, with the basal lobes of a paler rose colour. The blossoms last some two

<p><i>Cattleya guttata Leopoldii</i> requires the same treatment as that recommended for

Massange de Louvrex, is situated in the Ardennes, about 6 miles from Marche, and
some 80 miles from Brussels. The collection of Orchids at the Ch&acirc;teau is very
large, one of the finest in Belgium. In the house devoted to East Indian Orchids
there are some grand specimens of Vandas, A&euml;rides, and Saccolabiums. During a
visit in July last, we noticed in bloom a very fine variety of <i>Vanda tricolor
planilabris</i>, the flowers of which were very large, with fine broad sepals and petals,
the markings being well defined and the colour bright. Here was also a grand
plant of <i>V. Cathcartii</i>, about four feet high, in perfect health. Cypripediums are,
moreover, treated with great success in this house; indeed, we noticed some plants
of <i>C. caudatum</i> with extraordinary growths upon them, one plant having leaves as
much as eighteen inches long, and quite distinct in the character of its growth,
being almost erect. In the Cattleya house were some fine examples of <i>Cattleya labiata</i>,
the true autumn-flowering variety; also <i>C. Warnerii</i> in abundance, and <i>C. Mendelii</i>.
<i>Zygopetalum Gautieri</i>, the best variety, with dark blue flowers, was also open.
<i>C&aelig;logyne Massangeana</i>, had a spike of twenty-three flowers; this species is a grand
subject for treating as a basket plant, the spikes being of a drooping character;
we have seen it bearing as many as twenty-seven flowers on a spike. There
were, moreover, in the same house, some enormous plants of <i>Cattleya Trian&aelig;</i>, marvels
of cultivation, with good specimens of <i>L&aelig;lia elegans</i>, <i>L. anceps</i>, <i>L. Perrinii alba</i>,
<i>L. elegans prasiata</i>, <i>L. Stelzneriana</i>, <i>Cattleya Dowiana</i>, &amp;c., all in perfect health,
and doing well. In the Odontoglossum houses there was not much in flower, but
the plants were looking remarkably well and making enormous bulbs. Here we
noticed the largest plant of <i>Restrepia antennifera</i> we have ever seen; the plant
probably measured as much as eighteen inches across, and had some hundreds of
leaves. Masdevallias were well represented, and there were some good varieties in
flower: amongst others was a grand plant of <i>M. macrura</i>, as well as <i>M. Houtteana</i>
and <i>M. trochilus</i>, forming good specimens. We saw a splendid specimen of
<i>Odontoglossum citrosmum roseum</i> with nine flower-spikes, a marvel of good cultivation.
Altogether, we believe, this is the most select collection of Orchids in Belgium, and
great credit is due to Mr. Wilkie, the gardener, for the way in which he cultivates
his plants; his employer, however, spares no expense in providing the appurtenances
necessary to good cultivation.&mdash;<span class="sc">H. Williams.</span></p>

<p>Until quite recently but few species of <i>Pescatorea</i> were known in cultivation.
Latterly, however, several new ones have been introduced into this country, and
Orchid cultivators have now more numerous opportunities of admiring the beautiful
plants which are referred to this genus.</p>
<p><i>Pescatorea Klabochorum</i> was introduced from Ecuador, by Franz Klaboch, a
nephew of Herr Roezl, one of the most successful plant collectors of our time, and
is named in commemoration of him and his surviving brother, also a traveller and
collector, The first plants, brought home some four or five years since, were
purchased by Messrs. James Veitch and Sons, of Chelsea, and were distributed by
them; but since then it has been several times re-introduced, and is now to be
found in numerous collections. Several varieties have been already noticed. It appears
to have been first flowered in 1878 in England, by John Day, Esq., and in Scotland
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
by J. Gair, Esq., and again in 1879 in the noble collection of Sir Trevor Lawrence
Bart., M.P. The drawing reproduced in our plate was prepared from a plant which
flowered last August in our own collection, and represents a very fair variety. A
fine variety, which bloomed with W. Cobb, Esq., of Silverdale Lodge, Sydenham, is
figured in the revised edition of <i>Paxton&rsquo;s Flower Garden</i>.</p>
<p>The treatment which we find to suit this plant the best is to place it in the
Cattleya-house at the cool end. It should be potted in a compost of peat and
sphagnum moss, with a few lumps of charcoal added; and a liberal supply of water
should be given during the growing season, this being gradually decreased as the
winter approaches. The plants should be well elevated above the rim of the pot,
so as to allow any superfluous water to drain away from the crown.</p>
<p>We do not find that noxious insects attack the species of <i>Pescatorea</i> in any
great degree. The scale will sometimes take up its abode on the young growths,
but when found this can easily be removed by the use of a brush or sponge and
water.</p>
<p>We saw a fine lot of Pescatoreas and Bolleas in splendid condition at Falkirk
in September last, in the collection of J. Gair, Esq. These plants are not so easy
of cultivation as many Orchids, their treatment not being generally so well understood;
but this was not the case in this instance, for they were perfect plants, well
cultivated, and blooming freely. We noticed more especially a fine species named
in honour of Mr. Gair, which bears the richest coloured flowers we have ever seen;
of this we hope to give our readers an illustration when it flowers next year. These
plants were grown at the end of a house where a mixed collection of Orchids, such
as Cattleyas, Dendrobiums, A&euml;rides, and Saccolabiums, were doing well. Being a
large house, the plants could be treated according to their several requirements,
whereas in a small house the varied collection would not be found to do so well.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Vanda c&oelig;rulea.</span>&mdash;This <i>Vanda</i>, whose flowers are of such a distinct and beautiful
colour, is no doubt one of the finest Orchids in cultivation. We have had the
pleasure of seeing the plant we are about to mention for two successive years
blooming in great perfection in the collection of the Marquis of Lothian, at Newbattle,
Dalkeith. The plant, which stands one foot in height, and is well furnished
with good foliage, produced two spikes of its charming flowers, fourteen on each
spike. The sepals and petals are of a delicate lavender blue colour, barred and veined
with a deeper tint of the same; the lip is small, and of a dark violet colour. It
was a most showy object, and the amount of bloom upon it was extraordinary,
considering the small size of the plant. We have seen larger specimens, but never
one that has pleased us so well. Great credit is due to Mr. Priest for producing
such a plant, which is increasing in size, and in the number of its flowers every
year. There Is a good collection of Orchids being formed at this place, where the
houses are suitable for their cultivation, and the plants are well looked after and
cared for.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>The genus <i>Burlingtonia</i> was dedicated to the amiable and accomplished Countess
of Burlington, and contains a few small-growing but very beautiful species, which
come mostly from Brazil. The plant now under notice, which was the earliest
introduction, and the type of the genus, was imported from Demerara, in British
Guiana, so long since as 1834, by James Bateman, Esq., now a veteran in the study
and cultivation of Orchids. It is consequently well-known to the growers and collectors
of this class of plants.</p>
<p>As a subject for growing in a basket suspended from the roof, this species has
few, if any, equals. When grown in this way, the pendent spikes of white flowers
hanging over the sides of the basket produce a charming and distinct appearance.</p>
<p>The plant is compact-growing, and, like all the species of <i>Burlingtonia</i>, is
evergreen. The pendent flower-spikes are produced from the sides of the pseudobulbs,
and each bear from four to six flowers, which are white, marked with yellow in
the throat, and have a slight but pleasant odour of violets.</p>
<p><i>Burlingtonia candida</i> should be grown in the Cattleya-house, in a basket or pan,
suspended from the roof. Sphagnum moss, with a good drainage composed of crocks,
is the best material for its roots, and the bulbs should be well elevated above the
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
rim of the pan or basket. This plant delights in a plentiful supply of water at
the roots&mdash;in fact, it should never be allowed to get dry, as it requires but little
rest. It is propagated by division of the pseudobulbs.</p>
<p>Few insects attack this plant. The scale is the most frequent intruder, and this
is easily removed by the use of a sponge and clean water.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Ferguslie House, Paisley.</span>&mdash;We have been in the habit of visiting the gardens
of <span class="sc">T. Coates</span>, Esq., for many years past, and have always been surprised to see
the Orchids grown by Mr. Thompson, the gardener who has charge of them. There
is no house specially devoted to the cultivation of this class of plants, but they are
grown in different houses intermixed with stove-flowering plants, foliage plants, and
ferns, and in no instance have we seen East Indian Orchids grown to greater
perfection. We have from time to time witnessed the progress of the specimens we
are about to enumerate&mdash;in fact, we have seen them grown on from quite small plants
purchased some ten or twelve years ago, and the size to which they have attained
during this time, viz., up to the first week in September, 1881, will no doubt astonish
some of our readers, and convince them it is not true that Orchids cannot be
cultivated unless they have houses set apart for their especial benefit. In order to
show the error of this conclusion, we will name a few of the Specimens that we
saw growing on one side of a span-roofed house, with stove plants on the centre
stage. <i>A&euml;rides suavissimum</i>, grown from a small plant, is now a fine specimen
three feet high, having four stems, and in perfect health, the foliage reaching down
to the pot; it bore twenty spikes of its long racemes of flowers, many of them having
thirty-seven flowers on a spike, and was one of the most beautiful objects that have
come under our notice. There is also another plant produced from the same specimen,
bearing twelve spikes of its lovely blossoms, which were in full beauty. <i>A. Warnerii</i>
is a well-grown specimen, having several stems two to three feet in height, and this
blooms freely every year. <i>A. virens</i>, is also a fine plant, with three stems three feet
in height. <i>A. affine</i> is a wonderful specimen of good cultivation; it is generally of
slow growth, but in this case it has not proved so. <i>A. crispum</i> again, is well
cultivated, having two stems nearly three feet high, and perfect, and there is also
a second plant of the same, three feet in height. <i>A. Fieldingii</i> is a fine specimen.
<i>Vanda tricolor</i>, a well-furnished plant, and <i>V. suavis</i> four feet high, with three
stems, are both beautifully grown. A plant of the curious long-tailed <i>Angr&aelig;cum
sesquipedale</i>, from eighteen inches to two feet in height, has four stems, and is
undoubtedly the best grown specimen we have seen. <i>Phal&aelig;nopsis Schilleriana</i>, a good
specimen, with seven of its beautifully-marked leaves, is growing suspended over the
centre table. There are other choice Orchids, such as <i>Cypripediums</i>, <i>C&oelig;logynes</i>,
&amp;c. We also noticed, grown in two other houses, intermixed with various plants,
beautiful specimens of <i>L&aelig;lia Turnerii</i>, <i>L. elegans</i>, <i>L. anceps</i>, <i>Cattleya Trian&aelig;</i>, and
others. There are also well-grown examples of <i>Calanthe Masuca</i>, of <i>Dendrobium</i>, and
other good Orchids; but space will not admit of these being here enumerated.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

<p>The subject of our present illustration is an exceedingly rare plant, and is met
with in only a few collections. In its habit of growth and general appearance it
resembles the type <i>Anguloa Ruckerii</i>, but it is very distinct in colour, and is
altogether a more desirable plant, the flowers being of a much richer colour&mdash;a deep
rich blood-red spotted with a darker tint of the same&mdash;whereas in the original
<i>A. Ruckerii</i> they are of a fine orange colour spotted with dark brown.</p>
<p>The growth of this plant is very majestic, producing as it does bulbs four to
six inches high, and leaves from eighteen to thirty inches long, by four to six
inches broad. The flowers, which proceed from the base of the pseudobulb, are erect,
tulip-shaped, and of great substance and size, lasting as long as four weeks in
perfection. <i>A. Ruckerii sanguinea</i> is a very suitable plant for exhibition purposes
on account of the distinct appearance produced by its massive flowers when intermixed
with other Orchids.</p>
<p>The temperature best suited for this plant is that of the cool Orchid-house.
We have found it succeed well in pots in a compost of good fibrous peat, with
plenty of drainage. It requires a good season of rest, during which period the plant
should be kept rather dry until it begins to show renewed signs of growth, when
the supply of water may be increased. It is propagated by division of the pseudobulbs
just before they start into growth. We are indebted for the opportunity of
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
figuring this plant to Dr. Boddaert, of Ghent, Belgium, in whose collection it
flowered last July.</p>
<p>A fine figure of the original <i>Anguloa Ruckerii</i> will be found in <i>Warner&rsquo;s Select
Orchidaceous Plants</i>, 2nd series, t. 10; and it is also figured in the <i>Botanical
Register</i>, 1846, t. 41; and in <i>Moore&rsquo;s Illustrations of Orchidaceous Plants</i>, art.

<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cattleya Dowiana.</span>&mdash;We have received a very beautiful flower of this grand
Cattleya, by post, from R. Dodgson, Esq., of Blackburn, in whose fine collection the
plant has been grown. Mr. Osman, the gardener, says, &ldquo;we had three imported
plants last year, and two of them are now in bloom.&rdquo; We were pleased to hear
this, as <i>Cattleya Dowiana</i> is considered a difficult plant to flower, though we have seen
many plants blooming this season. There is no doubt that its cultivation is becoming
better understood. The variety above referred to has a large lip of a most intense
dark purple, striped and reticulated with golden yellow, in a very prominent manner.
The sepals and petals are large, of good substance, of a bright nankeen colour,
and produce a very pleasing and altogether distinct appearance. This is, undoubtedly,
one of the most distinct and beautiful of all Cattleyas. There is a grand figure of
this species in the 2nd series of <i>Warner&rsquo;s Select Orchidaceous Plants</i>, t. 27.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cypripedium Spicerianum.</span>&mdash;We were pleased to receive last month a splendid
bloom of this fine variety from J. S. Bockett, Esq., of Stamford Hill. There is
no doubt that it is one of the most distinct species of the whole genus. The
dorsal sepal is erect, curiously curved, pure white, of a wax-like texture, having a
purple streak extending from the base to the apex; the linear-oblong petals are
much crisped on the edge, and, like the other parts of the flower, are of a bronzy-green
colour, the lip being darker, of a reddish-brown and glossy. It has been
named in honour of H. Spicer, Esq., and was introduced from India some few years
ago. We also received at the same time a fine form of <i>Odontoglossum Chestertoni</i>,
and a most distinctly spotted variety of <i>O. Alexandr&aelig;</i>, the sepals and petals of
which are white, spotted with reddish-crimson, and the lip white, with a large
reddish-brown blotch on the lower portion.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

<p>The beautiful <i>Dendrobium Ainsworthii</i> is the result of a cross between <i>D. nobile</i>
and <i>D. heterocarpum</i>, and was raised by Mr. Mitchell, gardener to R. F. Ainsworth, Esq.,
M.D., Of Higher Broughton, Manchester, after whom it is named. In habit of growth
and in general appearance the plant partakes mostly of the character of <i>D. nobile</i>,
while the flowers more closely resemble those of <i>D. heterocarpum</i> in form, and have
in a slight degree the delicious fragrance of those produced by that species. In
<i>D. Ainsworthii</i> the flowers have white sepals and petals, while the lip is marked
by a dense blotch of a rich amaranth or mulberry-crimson. In the <i>D. Ainsworthii
roseum</i> now figured, the sepals and petals are of a bright rosy-magenta, and the lip
is more fully covered with a richer coloured deep crimson blotch. This variety is
extremely rare, and forms a charming contrast to the white blossoms of its sister
hybrid. The flowers will be found very useful for cutting, as they last for a
considerable time in water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p><i>Dendrobium Ainsworthii roseum</i> requires treatment similar to that given to
<i>D. nobile</i>. We have found it to do well in a compost of peat and sphagnum moss,
planted in pans suspended from the roof of the East India house, in a position
where it can get plenty of light and air. During the growing season this plant
enjoys a liberal supply of water, which after the bulbs have completed their development
may be gradually withheld, and the plant cooled down by placing it in the
Cattleya-house, where it should remain until the time of flowering, which extends
from February to June. Mr. Stevens, of Trentham, grows it very successfully,
suspended in a well-appointed plant stove, where it has abundance of light.</p>
<p>We remember seeing a splendid plant of <i>Dendrobium Ainsworthii roseum</i> exhibited
by Mr. Mitchell, at the Whitsuntide Manchester Show, in May, 1877, in the form
of a well furnished specimen two and a half feet in height and two feet in breadth,
the stems being literally smothered with some hundreds of its beautiful crimson-lipped
rosy-tinted flowers.</p>
<p>Referring to this same Manchester Show of 1877, Mr. Anderson, of Meadow
Bank, a well-known Orchid grower, writes of this plant, as follows (<i>Gardeners&rsquo;
Chronicle</i>, <span class="small">N.S.</span> vii., 750):&mdash;&ldquo;Possibly the gem of the Exhibition was <i>Dendrobium
Ainsworthii roseum</i>. This is a most remarkable seedling partaking of the character
of both its parents (<i>D. nobile</i> and <i>D. heterocarpum</i>), and in some respects superior
to either. In point of floriferousness none of its parents can lay claim to such a
quantity of nodes on the deciduous stems, each bearing, or rather emitting, its quota
of flowers. I counted on one stem sixteen short racemes, each two and three-flowered.
The flower itself has the sepals and petals of <i>moniliforme</i> rather than of <i>nobile</i>, white
shaded with an almost imperceptible tint of rose, and tipped distinctly with that
soft pleasing colour. The labellum is flat, like an expanded <i>heterocarpum</i>, reflexing
a little towards the centre, with a blotch covering three-quarters of its surface with
deep veined purplish or rather mulberry-crimson, edged very distinctly with white,
and the extremity slightly tipped with crimson. This I look upon as one of the
greatest gains in hybridization, whether we regard the colour of the flower, or the
general floriferousness of the plant, or its free although not awkward habit of growth.
As an Orchid enthusiast of the last five and twenty years, I would pronounce it one
of the greatest gains that may be counted up in the whole known Orchid family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Altogether this is a most desirable plant, and being easy of cultivation, and of
remarkably free-flowering habit, it should find a place in every collection.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This very beautiful brightly-coloured plant was discovered in Moulmein by Mr.
Thomas Lobb, who sent it to the Messrs. Veitch &amp; Sons, of Chelsea, about the year
1856. It is of remarkably free-flowering and decorative character, and is no doubt
one of the most beautiful species of this fine genus of Orchids, being valuable alike
on account of its compact-growing habit, and the strikingly ornamental nature of
its inflorescence. There appear to be several varieties of this plant distributed
through our Orchid collections, all of them handsome and deserving of cultivation,
but that which we now illustrate, from a finely grown, elegantly branching spike,
kindly sent to us by C. J. Hill, Esq., of Nottingham, and referred to in the note
published under Plate 15, is the finest form, and the most freely bloomed specimen
we have met with. We were, in truth, charmed with the size and colour of the
flowers of this plant, when recently inspecting Mr. Hill&rsquo;s collection, the long spikes
of blossom which were produced by so small a plant being quite extraordinary.</p>
<p>There is no genus of Orchids that surpasses <i>A&euml;rides</i> in having handsome evergreen
foliage, so that, even when not in blossom, they are exceedingly pretty objects;
while to this it must be added, that their flower-spikes are beautiful, and their
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
flowers deliciously fragrant; some, of course, are more handsome than others, but
all are worth growing: in fact, we have never seen an indifferent <i>A&euml;rides</i>. They
have every good quality that a plant of this character can possess, and they are of
easy cultivation, so that anyone who has a stove may manage them successfully.
They do not require so much heat as some persons imagine; the temperature need
not be above 65&deg; in the winter; more is, indeed, required in summer, but even
then sun-heat should be fully utilised, and very little fire-heat should be used.</p>
<p><i>A&euml;rides Lobbii</i> blooms in June and July, and lasts for three or four weeks
in beauty. The plant, from which our illustration was taken, was but a foot in
height, and the magnificent flowering racemes we saw upon it were fully two feet
six inches in length, with two branches each a foot in length. The sepals and
petals are white, spotted with bright rose colour; the lip is also of a bright rose
colour, slightly veined and margined with white. The flowers are deliciously fragrant.</p>
<p>The plant being very compact in growth, occupies but little space, so that
anyone having a small vacant place in the Orchid-house or plant stove, might readily
grow it. It will thrive either in a basket suspended from the roof of the house,
or in a pot planted in sphagnum moss, with good drainage, and a moderate supply
of water during the summer season, while in winter only just sufficient should be
given to keep the moss damp. The plants do not, however, like to be dried up,
as this often causes them to loose their bottom leaves, which is a great disfigurement.
They require plenty of light, but do not like to be exposed to the burning
sunshine. Canvas should therefore be used as a shading during all the bright sunny
portion of the day, but when the sun has, in some degree, lost its burning heat the
blinds may be raised. Never allow water to get into the hearts of the plants in
winter. In summer a fine rose should be employed to syringe them, which operation
should be done about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when the house is closed.</p>
<p>They should be always kept free from insects. Scale, thrips, and many other
insects are to be reckoned amongst their enemies, and cockroaches, if allowed to
attack them, will often eat away their young roots and flower-spikes.</p>

<p>The introduction of this splendid species of Lady&rsquo;s Slipper is one of the results
of Mr. F. W. Burbidge&rsquo;s visit to Borneo, in the service of Messrs. Veitch &amp; Sons,
of Chelsea. It is a very robust grower, and flowered for the first time in the
autumn of 1878, when it was named by Professor Reichenbach, in the place above
quoted, in honour of Sir Trevor Lawrence, Bart., M.P., an ardent orchidophilist, and
the possessor of a collection of Orchids of unequalled richness and beauty.</p>
<p>The Cypripediums now form a large family group, and rank amongst the most
useful of Orchids that can be cultivated, since the lasting quality of their flowers,
especially for exhibition and decorative purposes, is something extraordinary. Many
of them in addition possess beautifully variegated foliage, as in the species we now
figure, which has the leaves most distinctly marked with light and dark green.
Our drawing was taken from a very fine plant in the select collection of H. M.
Pollett, Esq., Fernside, Bickley, a gentleman who is a great lover of Orchids, and
who has the wisdom to secure healthy young plants at the outset, in order that he
may see them grow on into good specimens, such as the one now before us has
done. It gives one great pleasure to see plants so well cultivated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p><i>Cypripedium Lawrenceanum</i> has, as we have already said, beautifully marked
foliage, so that even when not in blossom, it is found to be an object of attraction.
The upper or dorsal sepals of the flowers were in this case three inches across,
white, striped with plum-purple, which runs in curved lines from the base nearly to
the margin. The petals are green along the upper edge, suffused with purple
towards the end, and having black wart-like spots, and a fringe of purple hairs
along the margin. The pouch or lip is large, of a reddish brown colour in front,
the under and hinder part yellowish green.</p>
<p>These plants are best grown in pots with peat, and a little charcoal, or sometimes
a little good fibrous loam mixed with the peat. It is a free-rooting species,
and likes to be well elevated above the pot rim, so that its roots can penetrate
readily and work freely in the rough material. The pot should be half filled with
drainage, so that a good supply of moisture may be given to the roots during the
growing season. The Cattleya or the East India-house seems to suit the plants well,
as in these structures they grow and flower freely.</p>
<p>The flowers are very useful for cutting, as they will keep a long time in
vases if the water is kept sweet and pure.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Baron Schr&ouml;der&rsquo;s Orchids.</span>&mdash;On the occasion of a recent visit to The Dell,
Staines, the seat of Baron Schr&ouml;der, we had the good fortune to inspect the fine
collection of Orchids which has been got together. The houses are well built, after
the plans of Mr. Ballantyne, the gardener, and are placed in good positions; not
only have the ventilation and heating power been well considered, but cleanliness
also; indeed the arrangement of the houses leaves nothing to be desired. The
Orchids were, at the time, looking remarkably well. Entering the Phal&aelig;nopsis house we
noticed a fine plant in flower of the rare and beautiful <i>Phal&aelig;nopsis intermedia Portei</i>,
a treat which seldom falls to one&rsquo;s lot, for it is a matter of regret that this splendid
Phal&aelig;nopsis is so rare in collections: it must be very scarce in its native habitat
or collectors would surely find it oftener. <i>Cypripedium Spicerianum</i> was also flowering
here. Several different species of <i>Nepenthes</i> were in fine character, growing above
a tank, with their pitchers gracefully drooping over the water, in which position
they seemed to be quite at home. In this house were also some grand plants of
different species of <i>Saccolabium</i>, <i>Cypripedium</i>, &amp;c., all doing well. Leaving the
Phal&aelig;nopsis house the Cattleya house, which runs at right angles to it, is next
entered. Here we noticed a gigantic specimen of <i>Cattleya exoniensis</i>, carrying several
spikes of flower; <i>L&aelig;lia autumnalis atrorubens</i>, with grand spikes, and flowers of
unusual size and fine colour; and <i>Dendrobium Wardianum</i> in full beauty, suspended
from the roof. The Cattleyas, &amp;c., in this house were in grand condition, and bid
fair to produce some fine spikes next season. In the Odontoglossum house <i>Zygopetalum
Gautieri</i> was flowering well, also <i>Miltonia candida</i> and <i>Sophronitis grandiflora</i>.
The East Indian Orchids were in an especially healthy condition, the
collection containing some grand specimens of <i>Vanda</i>, <i>A&euml;rides</i>, and <i>Saccolabium</i>.</p>
<p>This collection, which has been lately formed, bids fair to become one of the
finest in the country, Baron Schr&ouml;der being an enthusiastic lover of this handsome
class of plants, and being also careful to obtain only the best varieties.&mdash;H. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This interesting and distinct-looking <i>L&aelig;lia</i> was introduced from Brazil many
years ago by Messrs. Backhouse &amp; Son, of York, but from the limited quantity then
obtained it has always remained a scarce plant. It appears to have been imported
about 1858, as it was figured in 1859 in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i>, as above quoted.
It is, indeed, with great pleasure that we are enabled to introduce to our readers
a figure of so rare and so distinct a species, for it is seldom seen in collections,
having always been a rare plant. The colour of the flowers is of a nankeen-yellow,
consequently they strongly contrast with those of the generality of Orchids of this
affinity, the usual colours of which are purple, or rose colour in various tints, or
white.</p>
<p>Our plate was prepared from a drawing which was made in September last
from a plant which flowered in our own collection. It will be seen from the
representation, which is a very faithful one, that <i>L&aelig;lia xanthina</i> is really a very
pretty species, and one that our collectors ought to be looking after, so that Orchid
growers may have it supplied to them at a more reasonable price than at present.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The plant grows about a foot in height, and is somewhat like <i>L&aelig;lia purpurata</i>
in its habit of growth, only it is very much smaller and more compact and free-blooming.
The flowers continue about three weeks in perfection. It requires the
same kind of treatment as other species of <i>L&aelig;lia</i> and <i>Cattleya</i>, and thrives best
when cultivated in a pot or basket, with fibrous peat, and good drainage. Like the
rest of its class it requires to be kept as fully exposed to the light as possible, in
order that the pseudobulbs may be thoroughly ripened; and the growth being thus
more completely matured, it will be found to become more vigorous in character,
and enabled to throw up its flower-spikes more freely. There is a grand specimen
of this species, over two feet in diameter, in the collection of H. Shaw, Esq.,
Corbar, Buxton.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">L&aelig;lia autumnalis atrorubens.</span>&mdash;It is highly gratifying to find that this
splendid variety of <i>L&aelig;lia autumnalis</i>, is becoming more plentiful, and that it keeps
up its original character. Many growers were of opinion when it was first introduced,
that the large size of its flowers and the rich colour of the sepals and petals
were due mainly to superior cultivation and a pure atmosphere, but such is not the
case. We have flowered some plants of it this season in our own establishment at
Holloway, which have been as good, both in regard to the size and colour of the
flowers, as those of any of the plants grown in a purer atmosphere, away from the
smoke of this great City. We have received from the Right Honorable J.
Chamberlain, Esq., M.P., of Birmingham, a splendidly developed spike of a grand
form of this beautiful variety, which had been grown under the care of his gardener,
Mr. Cooper.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Odontoglossum vexillarium</span> (Autumn-flowering variety)&mdash;A short time back
Mr. W. Bull exhibited at South Kensington a recently imported form of <i>Odontoglossum
vexillarium</i>, which had all the appearance of being a distinct variety, flowering
during the autumn months of the year. It is, however, we think, somewhat premature
to regard this autumn-flowering character as thoroughly established, though there is
no doubt the variety is a distinct one, and remarkably fine in colour. This being
the first time of its flowering, the particular growth shown may have been influenced
by the time at which the plants were started. However, in due time, and with
good cultivation we shall see whether this peculiarity of flowering towards the end
of the year is really a constant character, or whether it may have resulted from
the circumstances above referred to.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>We ought to be cordially grateful to our plant collectors for introducing to
European gardens so brilliant, varied, and charming a set of epiphytal plants, as the
several showy ornamental, and pleasingly grotesque species of the genus <i>Masdevallia</i>.
There are indeed but few Orchids that possess such bright colours as are found therein.
A few years since we had but two species that were really worth growing, namely,
<i>M. coccinea</i>, of an orange-scarlet colour, and <i>M. tovarensis</i>, pure white. Then
came <i>M. Lindeni</i>, a charming plant with flowers of a rich magenta-purple colour.
<i>M. Veitchiana</i>, of which there are some very fine forms, made a fine contrast with
its glowing orange-scarlet and bright yellow, the scarlet flushed with purple. The most
beautiful, however, of all the Masdevallias are the varieties of <i>M. Harryana</i>, the
colours of which&mdash;shades of magenta-crimson&mdash;are most intense and brilliant, many of
the forms being also distinct in shape.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p><i>Masdevallia Harryana c&oelig;rulescens</i>, our present subject, was forwarded to us by
R. P. Percival, Esq., of Southport, who is forming what will in time doubtless become
one of the best collections of these plants in the North of England. Whatever
Mr. Percival takes in hand he carries out thoroughly, and this has led him to
build separate houses to suit the different classes of Orchids. Now as Masdevallias
prefer cool treatment they are best kept in a house by themselves: they require
but a small one, as they take up very little room; indeed they will thrive well
enough in the Odontoglossum house, for if their few wants are attended to, there
are no freer growing plants in cultivation. They increase very fast under good
treatment, and soon repay all the care which is bestowed upon them. They last a
long time in beauty and make grand exhibition plants, producing also, when in
bloom, a charming effect in the houses if intermixed with the various Odontoglots
and other cool Orchids. There are so many varieties that some of them will always
be in flower, but the best time to see them is from May to July. They are so
accommodating to the grower that many wonderful specimens have been produced
and exhibited during the last few years. When a plant is found to be too large it
may be divided, and the divided portions will go on increasing.</p>
<p>We have found good fibrous peat and sphagnum moss to suit well as material
for the potting of these plants. They thrive best in small pots. The roots should
not be disturbed too often; when, however, they require fresh material to root in,
it must be given them, as they are free rooting plants and prefer to have sweet
wholesome soil about them. They must also have good drainage, for they need an
abundant supply of water, and by giving them efficient drainage the water passes
off quickly without doing any harm, which it would do if allowed to become stagnant
about them. The plants should be placed near the light but so as to avoid the
sun&rsquo;s rays. A north house suits them best, as it shields them in summer from the
heat of the day, which they do not like, in fact, they should be kept as cool as
possible at all times, very little fire-heat being required in winter, and none during
the summer. They like fresh air, but in winter cold draughts must be avoided.
We find that they will thrive in a heat of from 45&deg; to 50&deg;: even somewhat less
would suffice, but the temperature here named is the most suitable. Anyone, therefore,
who possesses a small low house could grow them at a trifling expense.</p>
<p>They are easily propagated by dividing the tufts, leaving about three old stems
and a leading growth associated. The best time for the division to be effected is
just as they are beginning to grow. They should be placed in small pots until
they are established, when they should be removed to larger ones.</p>
<p>Insects should be annihilated as soon as they put in an appearance. The thrips
is their greatest pest. Cool Orchids, as a rule, are also subject to the attack of a
small kind of snail, that increases very rapidly, if not kept under by constant
watching night and morning. A few lettuce leaves placed in different parts of the
house, or potatos or turnips cut in half and scooped out in the centre, form good
traps for them, and by looking these over frequently many of them may be caught,
as also by moving the plants, as they are apt to harbour about the pots.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>The genus <i>Cymbidium</i> forms a small group of Orchids of which there are but
few species worthy of cultivation for ornamental purposes. That which we now figure
is one of the best of them, and is a very rare and very beautiful plant,
which has but seldom bloomed in this country. In the summer of 1878 Mr. Swan,
gardener to W. Leach, Esq., of Oakley Fallowfield, Manchester, flowered it for the
first time in Europe, and about the same time another specimen blossomed with
John Day, Esq., of Tottenham, which was subsequently purchased by us for 100
guineas. This latter plant has again flowered, and our sketch was taken from it.</p>
<p>Though a near relative of <i>Cymbidium eburneum</i>, this plant is considered by
Reichenbach to be a distinct species, the points of difference being&mdash;the broader
leaves with more prominent nerves on the upper surface; the somewhat smaller
flowers with shorter sepals and petals; and the different form of the segments of the
lip, together with some peculiarities in its callus and pubescence. It is one of the
treasures of India, having been originally discovered so long since as 1859, in
Moulmein, by the Rev. C. Parish, who found <i>Dendrobium crassinode</i> at the same
time. The plants of both these fine Orchids, then collected, were lost in the Ganges,
and the <i>Cymbidium</i> was not seen again for many years. It appears to have been
actually introduced shortly prior to 1874, since at that date living plants are
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
recorded as being rarities in the collection of Mr. J. Day, of Tottenham, and Mr. R.
Warner, of Broomfield, though it had not then flowered in Europe. It is a most
chaste and lovely plant, its graceful green foliage, and creamy white blossoms in which
the lip is spotted with crimson, producing a beautiful effect. The flowers have also a
pleasant perfume, and last for three or four weeks in perfection. The flowering season
is July and August, and several flowers are produced upon a spike, in which respect
it has a decided advantage on the score of beauty over <i>C. eburneum</i>, which
produces but one flower on a spike. The latter, however, is a charming Orchid for
winter and spring flowering, its ivory-white blossoms being then especially acceptable.
There is also another fine species, <i>C. Mastersii</i>, which produces its white flowers
during the dull months of autumn, when Orchid as well as other white flowers,
are scarce. These are all worth growing for the purpose of cutting, as they keep
for a long time in water.</p>
<p><i>Cymbidium Parishii</i> is very much like <i>C. eburneum</i> and <i>C. Mastersii</i> in its
manner of growth, and also in its general appearance; in fact, it is somewhat
difficult, when the plants are not in bloom, to distinguish the one from the other.
An inspection of our figure will, however, show that the foliage of <i>C. Parishii</i> is
broader and that it is of a lighter green colour.</p>
<p>It requires the same treatment as <i>C. eburneum</i>. We grow the plants in pots,
in the Cattleya house, on the side tables, near the glass. The material we use for
potting is rough fibrous peat and loam, with thoroughly good drainage, the plants
being also elevated above the rim of the pot. Their roots are thick and fleshy,
and they therefore require a good supply of water during the growing season, but
when at rest, the soil must be kept only just moist. They must be shielded from
bright sunshine, by blinds or some other means, otherwise their foliage will become
spotted. In winter they do not like to have their leaves damped, although in
summer, on warm days, it will not injure them.</p>
<p>They are propagated by dividing the tufts just as they are starting to make
fresh growth, leaving some of the established portion at the back of the new growth.
They must be kept free from insects. The white scale, which sometimes endeavours
to make its way on the foliage, is that chiefly to be guarded against.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Vanda tricolor.</span>&mdash;In November last, we saw in the collection of J. Broome,
Esq., of Didsbury, a very finely grown plant of <i>V. tricolor</i>, with two spikes of
exceedingly richly coloured flowers&mdash;one of the best we have ever seen. It is in
the way of the Dalkeith variety, but the flowers are large and of a remarkably
bright colour. Mr. Broome sent us a spike to figure but it was spoilt in the
transit; we hope, however, to be able to procure another when the plant again
blooms, so that our subscribers may see what a well-grown specimen it is. It stands
two feet six inches in height, and has beautifully healthy foliage down to the pot.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This fine Orchid first flowered in 1870, under the care of Mr. A. Williams, in
the collection of Joseph Broome, Esq., of Didsbury, Manchester, and subsequently in
that of E. G. Wrigley, Esq., of Bury. What is described as a still finer variety of
the same plant appeared shortly after in the collection of Consul Schiller, of Hamburgh.
One of the most remarkable and special peculiarities of the species is the powerful
fragrance of its flowers, which is so strongly developed as to scent the whole house
in which a blooming plant is placed.</p>
<p>It is a very rare as well as a very distinct species. We have, ourselves, only
met with one example in bloom, besides that from what our illustration was taken,
and that was the specimen in the collection of Mr. J. Broome, above referred to, as
being the first which bloomed in this country. Our figure was taken from a plant
which flowered recently in the grand collection of Sir Trevor Lawrence, Bart., M.P.,
who was good enough to send it for our artist to sketch, and he has succeeded
in securing a very faithful likeness of it. We have no doubt our collectors will
meet with it in their journeyings in its native country, but it must be rare there,
or we should have obtained more of it; most probably, like others of its genus, it
is difficult to secure. It resembles <i>Cattleya bicolor</i> in its habit of growth, the
stems bearing two leaves, which grow about twelve to eighteen inches in length.
The sepals and petals are of a rich tawny orange colour, irregularly spotted with
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
purple, and the lip has the side lobes yellow, and is white in front, and distinctly
striped with violet. Mr. Spyers says it blooms in September and October, when its
fragrance, combined with its distinct colour, renders it a very acceptable inmate of
the Orchid house; it also flowers at a time when few other Cattleyas are in bloom.</p>
<p><i>Cattleya velutina</i> requires the same treatment as the other Cattleyas, that is,
to be potted in peat soil with good drainage; it does not need so much water
at the roots as some kinds, but it should be borne in mind, on the other hand, that
it must not be allowed to shrivel, and therefore a little moisture should always be
supplied to the roots. If the plant once gets into an unhealthy condition its recovery
will be very doubtful. Those of the Cattleyas, such as <i>C. bicolor</i> and <i>C.
velutina</i>, which have very slender bulbs are more liable to go wrong than those that
form thick fleshy bulbs, the latter having more substance from which to draw their
support. They require to be kept near the light, with very little shade, excepting
just sufficient to keep them from the burning sun.</p>
<p>Like other Cattleyas, this species is subject to the inroads of the scale insect,
which should be frequently sought for, and, if found, promptly removed. The foliage
should be kept in a plump condition and not allowed to shrivel. In cleansing the
leaves injury is often caused by too hard rubbing, by which they become bruised;
rather should they be handled delicately, as, if once damaged, they cannot be
restored to a sound healthy appearance. A damaged leaf is not only a disfigurement,
but is of great injury to the health of the plant, by interfering with the
action of its pores. Cleanliness is one of the great secrets of success in plant
cultivation, but the operation of cleansing should be taken in hand before the insects
get a-head, or they will assuredly eat into the leaves, which will thus become
permanently injured at the points of attack.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Dr. Ainsworth&rsquo;s Orchids.</span>&mdash;When in Manchester we had the pleasure of visiting
the collection of R. F. Ainsworth, Esq., M.D., in whose fine and varied collection
the plant that most especially attracted our attention was <i>Masdevallia Chim&aelig;ra</i>, the
blossoms of which were very large, each flower measuring seventeen inches across.
The effect of these beautiful and curiously spotted flowers hanging around the basket
was very striking. We have had it sent to us to figure, but the flowers do not
travel well; we hope, however, some day, when it is in bloom, to be able to
figure it. We also noticed, in the same house, a wonderfully fine form of
<i>Odontoglossum Alexandr&aelig;</i>, with broad sepals and petals of beautiful white, while the
centre of the petals is marked with a pleasing rose colour, which gives it a very
pretty appearance; the lip is large, white, beautifully crisped round the edge, the
upper part bright orange-yellow. It was, altogether, a very showy flower. Mr.
Mitchell, the gardener, said it had been in bloom for several weeks, and it was
still fresh and fine when we saw it.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This very distinct species was first found by Hartweg, on the Peruvian Andes,
near Loxa, and was described by Lindley, in Mr. Bentham&rsquo;s account of the plants
collected by that traveller. It appears to have been introduced by M. Linden, and
to have been first flowered in his establishment, the figure published in <i>L&rsquo;Illustration
Horticole</i> having been derived from this source. The small compressed
pseudobulbs are formed at the end of a sucker or offshoot, which is invested by
large membranous bracts or scales, the upper of which covering the base of the
flower-scape is somewhat broader and leaf-like.</p>
<p>This Odontoglot ranks among the most distinct species of its genus, as
may indeed be seen by a glance at our illustration. It produces dense spikes of
its beautiful flowers, which are more in the way of those of <i>Odontoglossum
coronarium</i> than of any other cultivated species; it, however, blooms more freely.
The spike of flowers we have here represented was sent to us by Mons. F. Massange,
of Li&eacute;ge, in whose collection the gardener&mdash;Mr. Kramer&mdash;induces it to flower freely
every year. M. Massange is a great <i>connoisseur</i> of Orchids, and in his collection
are to be found many rare and valuable specimens, which have been frequently
exhibited during the past few years, including the Li&eacute;ge Exhibition of 1881.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p><i>Odontoglossum brevifolium</i> is a dwarf growing plant, and produces its erect
spikes of flowers from the side of the pseudobulbs. There were seventeen blossoms
on that which is here represented. The sepals and petals are of a bright chestnut-brown,
margined and slightly marked near the base with yellow, the lip is rich
yellow with two light brown patches at its base. It is altogether a strikingly
showy plant, and one that should be always cultivated amongst Odontoglots for its
distinctness of colouring.</p>
<p>The treatment which we find to suit the plant, is to grow it in a basket
suspended from the roof, as it requires and enjoys all the light that can be given
to it; but, of course, it needs to be shaded from the burning sun. The most
suitable material in which to grow the plant is sphagnum moss and fibrous peat.
It requires also a good supply of water in the growing season, so that it must be
thoroughly drained. It thrives best in a cool house in which the same temperature
is maintained as is found congenial to <i>Odontoglossum Alexandr&aelig;</i>, and others of that
class.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Odontoglossum Londesboroughianum.</span>&mdash;We have been under the impression that
this species was not so good as it was first reported to be, but we are now of
a different opinion. There are no doubt many varieties of the plant, as is the
case with nearly all Orchids. In their native countries they are produced freely
from seeds, all of the variations not being equally good. If our collectors could
only pick out the best, when in bloom, we should be saved many disappointments,
but of course they cannot spend their time in doing this. We were agreeably
surprised when we paid a visit to the collection of G. W. Law-Scholefield, Esq.,
New-Hall-Hey, Rawtenstall, near Manchester, to see a fine spike of the <i>O.
Londesboroughianum</i> with twenty-five of its large blossoms, much finer than any we
had ever seen before. The sepals and petals are yellow, barred with brown; the
lip is large, of a bright golden yellow, and very showy, and, as the long spikes
hung drooping among the white and coloured flowers of the other Orchids the
effect was very good. No one could complain of having such a species as this, for
it is a most showy flower.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cypripedium insigne.</span>&mdash;When calling at Mrs. Haywood&rsquo;s, Norris Green, Liverpool, a
few weeks ago, we were pleased to see a fine specimen of this old Orchid, which
was two feet in diameter; on nearly all the numerous scapes there were two
flowers, and very fine ones they were. Mr. Bardney, the gardener, informed us
that they come so every year, which makes this plant the more interesting, as the
character of the species is merely to produce one flower on a stalk. This plant was
grown in the grand conservatory, in which there was a most wonderful display of
blossom, in fact, the grandest lot of greenhouse flowers we ever remember to have
seen in winter, consisting of Pelargoniumns, Primulas, Camellias, Cyclamens, and the
<i>Luculia gratissima</i>, with 40 or 50 heads of bloom. There are not many Orchids
at this place, but, what there are, are doing well, and are well looked after.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This genus of Orchids does not comprise so many species as many others, but
among those which are known and introduced, are some which make very useful
autumn and winter flowering subjects, and which are well adapted for decorating our
stoves and Orchid houses. Amongst them occur some of the oldest of cultivated
Orchids, such as are generally to be met with in good old-fashioned places. We
remember to have seen plants of <i>Zygopetalum Mackayi</i> and <i>Z. crinitum</i> some thirty
years ago, also of <i>Z. maxillare</i>&mdash;grand specimens with from seventy to a hundred
flowers upon them, and a magnificent sight they were, with their numerous spikes
hanging around the foliage, as represented in the plate, and being similar in
colour.</p>
<p>The species which we now desire to bring to the notice of our readers, is a
very lovely one, which has been sometimes considered as a variety of <i>Zygopetalum
maxillare</i>, but the flowers are larger, and it not only blooms much earlier, but
continues in blossom for several weeks. In addition to this, it is a much freer
grower than <i>Z. maxillare</i>. We have had different plants in flower for several
months, and then they seemed as though they would continue blooming much longer;
in fact this species seems to flower whenever it makes its young growth&mdash;a peculiar
feature which renders it the most useful of its class.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Our plate was prepared from a plant which bloomed in the fine collection of
Mons. D. Massange, of Marche, in Belgium, under the care of Mr. Wilcke, who is
one of the most successful continental growers of Orchids. We had the pleasure
of seeing specimens from M. Massange&rsquo;s grand collection, exhibited at the great
show held at Brussels in July, 1880.</p>
<p><i>Zygopetalum Gautieri</i> is a dwarf growing kind, attaining a height of about twelve
inches, and is provided with distinct plaited green foliage. The flowers are large,
and borne several together on the spikes; the sepals and petals are green, blotched
with purplish brown, while the lip is of purplish blue, edged with a lighter tint of
the same colour.</p>
<p>There are several varieties of this species, varying from very pale violet to a rich
purplish blue, the variety here figured being one of the darkest-coloured forms we
have yet met with. The flowers are particularly showy, and last a long time in
perfection.</p>
<p>It is of easy cultivation, and not only free-growing but also free-blooming. It
does well in the Cattleya house, planted in peat and moss, with good drainage, and
it may be grown either in a pot or a basket, or on a block of wood, or on the
stem of a tree fern, on which latter it is frequently imported from its native country.
In its wild state, it appears naturally to creep up these fern stems, and it must look
very beautiful growing in this way, since its drooping spikes cannot fail to have a good
effect when thus seen hanging among the green foliage. It requires a good supply
of water during the growing season, but, when at rest, less will suffice. The plant
needs plenty of light, but it must be shaded from the fierce sun-rays during the
summer months.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">L&aelig;lia anceps Dawsoni.</span>&mdash;One of the best specimens we have had the pleasure
of seeing of <i>L. anceps Dawsoni</i> is in the collection of R. S. Dodgson, Esq.,
Blackburn; it had four spikes of buds when we saw it in November last; since then
we have received a spike of three flowers, and a very fine variety it is. Mr. Osman
informs us that the plant has ten expanded blossoms. It is one of the best plants
and as good a variety as we have met with; the sepals and petals are large, pure
white, and of great substance; the lip is bright rosy purple edged with white, the
throat orange, veined with purple. No doubt there are different varieties in
cultivation which were imported along with this some years ago. Mr. Dodgson&rsquo;s
plant is grown suspended from the roof, and from its appearance this seems to be
the best method of growing it to perfection. It likes plenty of light all the year
round, and should be just kept shaded from the burning sun.</p>

<p>The plant which we now bring under the notice of our readers belongs to a
rather extensive genus of Orchids, some of the species of which are very beautiful,
while others are not worth cultivating as decorative plants. That which is now before
us, is, however, an exceedingly handsome and very remarkable species, which was
imported from Assam, by MM. Jacob-Makoy &amp; Cie., of Li&egrave;ge, Belgium. Our illustration
was taken from a very fine plant, which produced no fewer than eight of its long
pendulous racemes of flowers, some of these having as many as twenty-seven blossoms
on them. This grand specimen was grown in the notable collection of Mons. D.
Massange, at the Ch&acirc;teau de Baillonville, near Marche, in Belgium, in whose honour
the species was named by Professor Reichenbach. We had the pleasure of seeing
this extraordinarily fine plant, growing under pot-culture, in M. Massange&rsquo;s Cattleya
house, and since then we have received the materials from which our artist has made
the capital representation which accompanies these remarks. In regard to its botanical
affinities it stands near to the Bornean <i>C&oelig;logyne asperata</i>, which is sometimes called
<i>C. Lowii</i>.</p>
<p>One remarkable feature of this <i>C&oelig;logyne Massangeana</i> is the extraordinary
shortness of time which it takes to develope its rather ample spikes of flowers; these
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
are often pushed up from the pseudobulbs in their corkscrew-like fashion, and become
extended to their full length in a very few days, the buds swelling off at once,
and the flowers very soon appearing in full beauty, in which state they continue
for four or five weeks.</p>
<p>We have seen a wonderfully fine example of this plant in the grand collection
of R. Smith, Esq., Brentham Park, Stirling; this was suspended from the roof, and
bore several fine flower-spikes. Mr. Smith regards this as one of the most beautiful
C&oelig;logynes in cultivation. When we saw the plant, it was overhanging a wonderful
specimen of <i>Cattleya exoniensis</i>, a grand variety, and there were also many other
fine Cattleyas in the same house.</p>
<p><i>C&oelig;logyne Massangeana</i> is a free-growing evergreen plant, with stout pseudobulbs
from three to four inches in height, each supporting a pair of light green plicate
leaves, which are about eighteen inches high, and about four inches broad. The flower-spikes
are produced from the base of the pseudobulbs, and, when the plants are in
vigorous health, they frequently attain the length of eighteen inches, or sometimes
two feet. The sepals and petals are of a light yellow-ochre colour; the lip rich
brown, its upper part or side lobes creamy yellow, lined with brown. The plant
flowers at various times of the year. We have more than once had it in bloom
twice in one year, and it continues for several weeks in a state of freshness and
beauty.</p>
<p>In its native country, Assam, this species is found growing on the branches and
stems of trees. Here, provided it receives proper treatment, it is a very free-growing
Orchid, and is also easy of increase, as it often produces two growths from one bulb.
It will thrive either in a basket or in a pot, but, when in bloom, it should be
suspended from the roof in order that it may be seen to the best advantage, to
accomplish which, if it be grown in a pot, some wire may be fixed around the rim
by which to hook it up. When growing it may occupy any part of the
Cattleya house, but it should be placed so that it can obtain plenty of light. When
hung up near the glass it must be shaded from the burning sun. With us it
thrives well in good fibrous peat, and we have found it to be a free-rooting plant,
requiring to be kept moist during the growing season; indeed, we never allow the
plants to become too dry, but just supply them with sufficient moisture to prevent
them from shrivelling. Every effort must be made to keep the foliage clean, and free
from insects, in respect to which the cultivator should adopt and act up to the
golden maxim&mdash;&ldquo;Prevention is better than cure.&rdquo;</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cymbidium eburneum.</span>&mdash;In our remarks on this plant, under <a href="#fig25">Plate 25</a>, we have
inadvertently referred to it as producing but one flower on a scape. This, however,
is not quite correct; as, although the scapes each usually bear but a solitary blossom,
we have known them to produce two, or sometimes even three flowers.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

<p>We have here one of the most beautiful of this charming class of Orchids, and
one which no Orchid fancier can fail to admire. The showy blossoms of the forms
of this species offer many shades of colour, those of the variety before us being
exceedingly chaste and delicate. The accompanying figure is a good representation of
this charming variety, and was prepared from a sketch of a well-grown specimen
which bloomed in the fine collection of W. Lee, Esq., Downside, Leatherhead, under
the care of Mr. Woolford, the gardener.</p>
<p>This L&aelig;lia grows about eighteen inches high; it is furnished with bold thick
foliage of a pleasant green, and produces its blossoms in June and July, continuing
for about three weeks in beauty. The sepals and petals are of a pure white, while the
lip is of a rich magenta-crimson, the two colours making a well-marked and charming
contrast. This delicately beautiful variety is extremely rare.</p>
<p><i>L&aelig;lia elegans alba</i> is like the Cattleyas in its growth, with the exception of the
stems being more slender, most of them producing two short leaves about six inches
in length. The plants require the same temperature and the same material in which
to grow as the allied Cattleyas, and also about the same amount of water during
the growing season. The rest required is also the same as for Cattleyas. There are
some of the species, such as <i>L. albida</i>, <i>autumnalis</i>, <i>majalis</i>, <i>pumila</i>, and others,
which will thrive better in a cooler temperature. They are all subject to insects,
which should be diligently looked after. White scale is sometimes troublesome, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
if allowed to remain on them will disfigure the foliage by causing yellow spots.
Thrips will also attack them, and increase very fast if they are not kept under by
adopting the usual remedies.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Shading Orchids.</span>&mdash;This is a subject of the greatest importance in Orchid culture,
and one that is often overlooked until it is too late&mdash;the mischief being done. What
is required is a strong durable material that will wear well, and, where rollers are
used, stand the strain upon it. It must also be understood that shading does not
consist of merely daubing upon the glass some opaque material, such as paint, summer
cloud, whitening, or the like, which though all very well as palliatives in positions
where rollers cannot be used, such as at the ends and sides of a house, are greatly
to be deprecated as a shading for the roof, for this reason, that in our English climate
we are so subject to sudden changes of the weather, that were such a permanent
shading to be used, we should frequently, especially during dull weather, have our
plants in comparative darkness when they should be getting all the light possible.
This cannot fail to lead to bad results and produce a sickly growth. Some growers
use thick canvas; indeed, we have done so ourselves many years ago, but, by experience,
we have found out the ill effects of it, for when we employed this kind of shading,
we found the plants under its influence became weak and sickly, producing small puny
flower-spikes. A lighter shading was then employed, and the difference was marvellous;
the plants assumed quite a different aspect. It was at this time that we were
exhibiting at Chiswick the fine specimens of East Indian Orchids&mdash;A&euml;rides, Saccolabiums,
Vandas, Dendrobiums, and many others&mdash;such as we seldom see equalled now. Since
then we have used thinner shadings, with the best results. Our Vandas thus treated
have always been strong and healthy, with broader foliage, producing their flower-spikes
as often as three times a year, with the flowers of a good colour, lasting a
long time in perfection; in fact we are never without flower, always having a good
display. We refer more particularly to the suavis and tricolor section of the genus.
Some people imagine Vandas do not flower till they attain a large size, but such
is not the case if they are properly grown, and thin shading is used. Our
experience leads us to the belief that all Orchids, with a few exceptions, require
a thin shading, that is to say, one that, while warding off the direct rays of the
sun, will allow the light to enter through it. To arrive at this result we use a strong,
durable, cotton netting, woven in small squares, close enough to exclude the rays
of the sun, while the light penetrates it with but little interruption. This netting
stands exposure to the weather much longer than canvas, and on that account is
cheaper in the long run. We have used this material for some years; in the case
of Cool Orchids, Mexican, and East Indian kinds, with the best results, the netting
being attached to rollers with appropriate gear. For the cool Orchid houses we
employ raised blinds, upon which we hope to speak further shortly. The blinds can be
managed with but little trouble. In the winter we take them off the house and put
them in a dry place until they are required again in the ensuing spring.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This Hybrid is one of the most distinct and charming of Orchids, as well as
one of the most useful for winter decoration. Our illustration was prepared from
some admirably grown materials which were kindly sent to us from the rich
collection of William Leach, Esq., of Oakley, Fallowfield, near Manchester, where we
have seen as many as one hundred flower spikes of one of the most highly coloured
forms of this somewhat variable plant in full beauty; and, intermixed as they were
with the white <i>Calanthe vestita</i>, the effect produced was exceedingly pleasing and
attractive. Mr. Swan seems to have hit upon the most successful method of cultivating
these very charming plants, for some of the spikes bore as many as forty
flowers. He evidently knows also how to arrange the plants to advantage, namely,
by placing them in rows among the foliage of the East Indian Orchids, so that the
Calanthes, blooming as they do without their leaves, have their beauty enhanced
by the foliage of the associated plants, especially that of the A&euml;rides and Vandas.</p>
<p><i>Calanthe Veitchii</i> is of deciduous habit, losing its foliage just as it comes into
flower. We have, however, occasionally seen it with leaves accompanying its flowers,
though its natural habit is to lose them. It produces flower spikes from three to four
feet or more in length, and sometimes bears as many as fifty flowers on one spike. The
plants are free-blooming and continue in flower for two months. The sepals and petals,
as well as the lip, are of a rich rosy pink colour. A gay appearance may be kept
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
up throughout the dull months of winter by having a sufficient number of plants and
starting them successively into blossom.</p>
<p>These Calanthes are very accommodating, since they will thrive well in baskets
suspended from the roof, as well as in pots suspended by wire in the same way
as the baskets; they will also thrive in pots standing on the tables, where room
is not an object. If grown in baskets, they will require more water in their growing
season. We prefer them grown in this manner where there is room, as they look
so pleasing with their spikes hanging gracefully from the roof. Where hundreds of
spikes have to be produced, as for instance is the case with Mr. C. Penny, of
Sandringham Gardens, for decorating the Prince of Wales&rsquo; table, the effect produced is
charming, and even for filling large vases they form a most elegant adornment.</p>
<p>They are of easy cultivation when they get the treatment they require. Like
all other deciduous and bulbous plants their blooming season follows that of the
completion of the growth of the bulbs, and their growing season commences when they
have finished blooming, after which they will soon begin to throw up their young
growths. When this is observed, let them be fresh potted. We have found it best
to do this every year, as they lose all their old roots annually. We shake the
soil away and cut off all the roots, and repot them, when, as soon as they begin
to grow, they will send out their new roots into fresh soil. The material we use for
potting is good rough fibrous loam and leaf mould, with a little rotten manure,
mixing them well together, and giving good drainage with a layer of rough peat and
moss on the top of it. In potting, fill the pot up with the soil and place the
bulb on the top, just making it firm; it will soon root and support itself. If
planted in baskets, it is necessary to place some rough fibrous peat round the sides
and at the bottom to keep the soil from washing out; fill the basket up with the
same kind of compost as that recommended for the pots, with drainage at the
bottom; place the bulbs upright in the basket, about three in number, on the top
of the soil, and finish by giving a little water. After the plants get into growth
and are making roots freely, they should always be kept moist until they have
finished their growth, when a less copious supply will suffice; and after they have
bloomed they may be kept dry for a time until they are ready for potting. When
the plants are in vigorous growth a little manure water may, with advantage, be
applied to their roots once or twice a week, but it must be well diluted before
being used, as, if given too strong, it might destroy the roots.</p>
<p>We find the East India house to suit these Calanthes best, or they will thrive
well in a house where stove plants are grown. They are propagated by separating
the pseudobulbs at the time they are potted, and as they generally make two
growths from one bulb the increase is comparatively rapid. Like other orchidaceous
plants, they must be kept free from insects.</p>

<p>This is undoubtedly one of our oldest Orchids&mdash;one that we recollect to have seen
in bloom with the Messrs. Loddiges, in their noble collection of Orchids, about thirty
years ago. We have always been under the impression that it was one of the prettiest
of the spotted Oncidiums, but, although we have occasionally bloomed it, since then we
have seen it in very few collections. We were accordingly very greatly pleased to meet
with a remarkably fine example of it in the collection of G. W. L. Schofield, Esq., of
Rawtenstall, near Manchester, from which our illustration was taken. The plant bore
two flower-spikes, one of which was three feet six inches in length, bearing forty fine
blossoms, and was a most beautiful example of the species; the other was shorter,
and from this our drawing was made, as our page would not afford space for the
representation of the larger spike. Our readers will, however, be enabled from the
description and figure to form a good idea of the beauty of this rare species when
well grown. Mr. Schofield is a great lover of good Orchids, and apparently intends
having a fine collection of them, as he has had houses built for the different classes;
his gardener also takes great interest in the plants, and consequently they are closely
looked after and well cared for.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>The <i>Oncidium h&aelig;matochilum</i> is a very compact-growing plant, with leaves from nine
to twelve inches in height, and two and a half inches broad, of a dark green colour,
spotted with brown. The sepals and petals are of a greenish yellow, mottled with
crimson; the lip is of a rich crimson, edged with yellow, and spotted round the margin
with magenta-rose colour. It flowers in November, the blossoms continuing for several
weeks in perfection, and is a plant that will no doubt become popular, as it blooms at
a time when flowers are in request. The specimen we are describing was grown in a
basket in the Cattleya house, in peat and moss, which form an unexceptionable
compost for it, with good drainage, and a moderate supply of water in the growing
season. It is best suspended from the roof where it may obtain plenty of light,
but it does not like bright sunshine, and consequently must be shaded in sunny
weather.</p>
<p>The Oncidiums are a class of Orchids among which occur some most showy and
beautiful species; while almost every colour we could mention is to be found
represented among them. They come from different regions, and in consequence their
treatment must vary. Some of them rank among our finest exhibition plants, as well
as amongst the best for the decoration of our stoves and Orchid houses. We often see
fine specimens of Oncidiums in our grand old collections of plants where there is no
pretence at growing a collection of Orchids, but where they are merely cultivated
for cutting purposes. What is more airy and elegant for vases than the
inflorescence of <i>Oncidium flexuosum</i>, or even <i>O. sphacelatum</i>, or that of many
others we could mention if space would allow? What more brilliant than such species
as <i>O. varicosum</i> and its variety <i>O. Rogersii</i>, <i>O. ampliatum majus</i>, <i>O. tigrinum</i>,
<i>O. Marshallianum</i>, or <i>O. macranthum</i>?</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Dendrobium Findleyanum.</span>&mdash;This plant is now (January, 1882) finely in flower
in the collection of J. C. Bowring, Esq., Windsor Forest. It must be a grand
specimen, as Mr. Clinkaberry, the gardener, informs us that it has one hundred and
ninety-two expanded blossoms. We have never before heard of such a well-flowered
specimen as this; indeed, large plants of this species are somewhat rare. It is a
most curious grower, and very remarkable for its long tapering compressed and deeply
nodose stem-like pseudobulbs. The flowers are large, white, tipped with rosy pink,
in the same way as those of <i>D. Wardianum</i>, and they are produced in great
profusion. It is a plant that takes but little room, and should be in every
collection.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>The plant we are now about to describe is one of the most magnificent members
of its genus, so far as regards the brilliant colouring of its flowers. This may be
seen by a reference to the accompanying illustration, which was taken from a fine
plant that flowered at the Victoria Nursery, and was subsequently purchased by
William Lee, Esq. of Downside, Leatherhead. The plant was seen to great advantage
when suspended in a basket from the roof of the Orchid-house, and in this position
was greatly admired, by <i>connoisseurs</i> on account of its rich and brilliant colours.
The plants of <i>Cattleya superba</i> vary considerably in the colour of their flowers,
those of the original or type form being well represented in the first series of
<i>Warner&rsquo;s Select Orchidaceous Plants</i> (t. 24), where a most beautiful spike with
six of its really superb flowers is shown.</p>
<p>The variety which we now introduce to the notice of our readers&mdash;<i>Cattleya
superba splendens</i>&mdash;is one of distinct character, and of unparalleled beauty. It comes
from a different country, viz., the Rio Negro region of Para instead of Guiana. The
plant is of compact growth like <i>C. superba</i>, and generally flowers during July and
August; the stems (pseudobulbs) are ten to twelve inches in height; the leaves
are produced in pairs, and are longer and more pointed, and its splendidly
coloured flowers are produced four or five together in the spike from the top of
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
the stem when it is making its growth. The individual blossoms are as much as
five inches across, and are well expanded, the sepals and petals being of a bright
but delicate rose colour, and the lip white at the base, the front and side lobes
rich magenta-crimson, the disk and interior of the tube being of a bright golden
yellow. The plant continues in blossom for three or four weeks if the flowers are
kept from damp; indeed, all Cattleya blooms retain their freshness for a longer
period if kept dry, especially the large light-flowered forms of <i>C. Mossi&aelig;</i>, <i>C. Trian&aelig;</i>,
<i>C. Mendelii</i>, &amp;c., which soon become spotted if the atmosphere surrounding them
is much charged with moisture.</p>
<p><i>Cattleya superba</i> is not in general well cultivated, but we have seen some
specimens which were grown with extraordinary skill and success in the select
collection of O. Schneider, Esq., of Cromwell Grange, Fallowfield, near Manchester.
These specimens, as many as nine in number, were suspended in baskets from the
roof of the warm house. They were grown from imported plants, and we have
noticed them in the same position growing and blooming freely for the past three
years, and, as they succeed so well, we should certainly recommend their being
retained in the same situation. It is a golden rule for cultivators that when a
particular kind of plant is found to thrive in a certain position, it should be kept
there, so long at least as the conditions are suitable. In the instance just referred
to the plants were suspended close to the glass, where they enjoyed a great
abundance of light, and this was possibly the secret of their success. Other
important considerations are that the plants do not like to be disturbed and will not
bear cutting up.</p>
<p>It is necessary at all times to keep sweet healthy material about the roots by
removing the old effete soil and replacing it by that which is fresh and sound.
We find rough fibrous peat and charcoal to suit it, but this must be accompanied by
good drainage. We have seen them thrive well on blocks of wood, but when grown
in this way they require more water. If cultivated in baskets they also need a
good supply during the season of growth. In winter less will suffice, merely enough
being given to keep the bulbs in a plump condition. As soon as they show signs
of growth, more water should be given, but it is necessary to avoid wetting the
young growths, as this often causes them to damp off, and when this is the case
the succeeding growth will be weakly and unable to develop blossoms.</p>
<p>The plants should be kept free from insects; sometimes thrips will attack the
young growths, but it should be speedily removed, as, if allowed to remain, it will
soon make great havoc.</p>

<p><i>Paphinia</i> is a genus of very limited extent, and of which but few species are
at present known. That now before us is a very old and familiar species, one of
the best known amongst them, and a singularly handsome little plant. It was the
<i>Maxillaria cristata</i> of early Orchid days, and considerable quantities of it were
formerly imported, but it has now become very rare. We have flowered several plants
during the past year at the Victoria Nursery, where they were greatly admired by
those who saw them. It is a plant which comparatively few persons interested in
Orchids have met with in blossom, and of which our plate gives a very correct
representation. The flowers are remarkably curious, not only for their structure, but
also for their colouring, as will be seen by reference to our illustration. The plant
has, moreover, a very peculiar mode of throwing out its flower-spikes.</p>
<p>We have also flowered <i>Paphinia rugosa</i>, another very singular and pretty plant,
after the same style, but differing in colour, and well worth cultivation. They occupy
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
but little space in the Orchid-houses, and are best grown in small pans suspended
near the glass where they have the full benefit of the light, but must be shaded from
the sun since their thin-textured leaves would suffer injury from too complete an
exposure.</p>
<p><i>Paphinia cristata</i>, is a low-growing plant, with small shiny pseudobulbs, and light
green plicate foliage about eight inches in height. It is a free-blooming species,
generally producing three flowers on a scape which proceeds from the base of the
pseudobulb after that has completed its growth. The flowers last in beauty for about
a fortnight, and are produced at different periods of the year. The sepals and petals
are nearly covered with transverse parallel lines of dark chocolate-purple on a creamy
yellow ground; the lip is coloured in a similar manner, and furnished with some
curious tufted fringes.</p>
<p>These plants are not so easy to cultivate as some other Orchids; but, by bestowing
on them a little extra care and attention, they may be kept in a thriving and healthy
condition. We find them to grow best in small pans, nearly filled with drainage, and
a lump of charcoal on the top of it; place the plant on the top of this with but little
rough fibrous peat or live sphagnum moss about the roots, and so that it is elevated a
little above the rim, as it has the peculiarity of throwing its flower-spike downwards.</p>
<p>This species is a native of Guiana, and of the adjacent island of Trinidad. In
the latter it is found growing on decayed branches of trees in the neighbourhood of the
mud lake. In the former it occurs in the warmer parts of Demerara, and, consequently,
must be cultivated in the warm house, and kept in a moist atmosphere during the
season of its growth; when at rest, however, a smaller quantity of water will suffice,
but it should never be allowed to shrivel, as, when once its condition becomes bad, it
is very difficult to restore its health.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Odontoglossum Alexandr&aelig; flaveolum.</span>&mdash;Whoever expected ten years ago to
see a yellow-flowered <i>Odontoglossum Alexandr&aelig;</i> (?) No one, we should think, unless
it were by a great stretch of the imagination. However, here is one from the fine
collection of G. Hardy, Esq., of Timperley, Manchester. The flowers in every respect
resemble those of <i>O. Alexandr&aelig;</i>, except in their colour, which is a bright canary-yellow.
The spike before us bears fifteen expanded flowers, and is one of the
greatest surprises we have had the good fortune to meet with for a long time. It
is true that distinct varieties of this &ldquo;the Queen of Orchids&rdquo; are turning up almost
every day, but one seldom has a chance of seeing an entirely new break of colour
of this sort. We believe that a variety with yellow flowers bloomed some time ago
in the Broomfield collection, but the colour was not so decided in Mr. Warner&rsquo;s plant
as it is in the case now before us.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

<p>The charming <i>Odontoglossum Andersonianum</i>, supposed to be a wild mule
between <i>O. Alexandr&aelig;</i> (<i>crispum</i>) and <i>O. pr&aelig;stans</i> or <i>O. gloriosum</i>, is one of the
many prettily spotted Odontoglots which have been introduced into our collections
during the past few years, and among which new varieties are continually appearing.
One of the best forms of this plant which has come under our notice is that
represented in the accompanying plate, prepared from a very beautiful specimen
which bloomed last year among many other fine Odontoglots, well cultivated in the
collection of Messrs. William Thomson &amp; Sons, of Clovenfords near Galashiels.</p>
<p>The <i>Odontoglossum Andersonianum</i> is a compact-growing plant, with pyriform
pseudobulbs two to three inches high, pale green leaves, and gracefully drooping
branched flower-spikes about two feet in length. The sepals and petals are at first
creamy white, spotted with purplish brown, the lip being also white, but less heavily
spotted. The plant is of free-blooming habit, the flowers continuing fresh and perfect
for a period of five or six weeks. It is exceedingly difficult to recognize this
form until it produces its blossoms, as its growth is remarkably similar to that
of <i>O. Alexandr&aelig;</i>. Indeed there are many forms and varieties of this particular
group which it is impossible to recognize until their flowers are seen; and, though
cultivators may sometimes feel assured of the identity of individual plants, the
production of flowers not unfrequently proves them to be mistaken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p><i>Odontoglossum Andersonianum</i> requires the same treatment as <i>O. Alexandr&aelig;</i>
and other cool Orchids, also the same amount of water. The plants must have
good fibrous peat to grow in, and plenty of drainage, as they need to be freely
supplied with water all the year round, and this, if allowed to become stagnant,
would prove very injurious to them. The material in which they are grown must
also be clean and sweet; and though they must never be over-potted, sufficient
space should be allowed for their roots. We have sometimes seen Odontoglots in
pots far too large for them, and though this may tend to make the plants more
important-looking, yet it will eventually spoil them, as the larger amount of soil
becomes soddened with water, and this produces rotting of the roots.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Raised Blinds for Orchid Houses.</span>&mdash;During the summer months we have found
Raised Blinds very beneficial to the growth of Orchids, especially to those requiring
cool-house culture. When the hot summer&rsquo;s sun is shining upon the glass, it is very
difficult, where Raised Blinds are not employed, to keep the temperature sufficiently
low. The glass roof of the structure upon which the sun is shining becomes very
hot, even when shaded with ordinary blinds; but if Raised Blinds are used a current
of air is allowed to pass over the entire surface of the roof, and the glass is kept
comparatively cool. The effect of this is to decrease very appreciably the internal
temperature of the house; and the moisture, which would otherwise be dried up
by the burning heat of the sun, produces a nice humid genial atmosphere in which
Orchids delight. Having thus far referred to the advantages to be derived from
the use of this method of shading, we may now explain briefly the mode of construction.
Supposing that the house to be furnished with Raised Blinds is an ordinary span-roofed
structure, it is necessary in the first place to provide a second ridge elevated about
six inches above the top of the existing one. This should not consist of a solid
plank, but of a strip of timber sufficiently strong to bear the weight and strain of
the blinds and roller, and should be supported on blocks of wood placed at intervals
in order to allow the current of air from below to find an outlet, which would not
be the case if a solid ridge-board were adopted. Having arranged for the ridge,
the next thing is to provide supports for the rollers; either wood or iron may be used
for this purpose, but we have found iron to be the lightest looking and the most
durable. Where the length of the rafters does not exceed say eight feet, half-inch
rod iron will be found to be strong enough, and this should be cut into proper
lengths, with the lower end turned up in a semi-circular form, so as to catch the
roller when it descends, and prevent it from running off the supports. These
supporting rods should be fixed to the bars or rafters of the house, about six inches
above the woodwork, by being welded to vertical iron stays, which latter should be
flattened out at the base, and provided with holes so that they can be screwed to
the rafters or bars of the roof. In this way a strong support for the blinds to roll
upon will be formed; the blinds themselves can be attached to the elevated ridge in
the ordinary way, and the gearing usually employed for the purpose will be found to
answer well for pulling them up or down. Many Orchid growers have already
adopted these Raised Blinds with very beneficial results.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This new Lady&rsquo;s Slipper is one of a batch raised some few years since by
Robert Warner, Esq., of Broomfield, near Chelmsford, who has been successful in
producing several very good forms by the process of hybridisation. The plants are
of dwarf habit, free-growing, and free-blooming, each small growth bringing forth its
flower. This <i>Cypripedium politum</i> has been flowered for several years past by Mr.
Warner, and thus its characteristic features and its constancy are well ascertained.
There are also some other distinct kinds obtained through the same cross, some
of which we hope to figure on a future occasion. We should expect that the cross
was made between <i>C. barbatum superbum</i> and <i>C. venustum</i>.</p>
<p><i>Cypripedium politum</i> is a plant of compact habit and of free growth. The
leaves are of a distinct and well-marked character, as will be seen in the very
accurate portrait furnished by our artist. They are oblong, acute, about five inches
long, and somewhat over an inch broad, of a beautiful light green, barred and
chequered with a very deep or bottle-green, which gives it a very pleasing
appearance; the under-surface is stained with a deep reddish wine-purple. The
downy flower-scapes are also purple, some six to eight inches in height, each
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
supporting a solitary flower, in which the dorsal sepal is ovate, polished, flushed in
the lower part with purplish red and spotted with purple at the base, the upper
part white, and the whole traversed by bright green veins which are alternately
long and short. The petals are oblong, broadest at the apex, of a bright wine-red,
polished, with black hairs along the margin, and Indian-purple warts near the
upper edge, greenish towards the base and along the lower edge. The pouch-shaped
lip is nearly as long as the petals, purplish red with a coppery tinge, glossy, veined
with green at the sides and back. The flowers are produced during January and
February, a season when they are much in request for decorative purposes. The
Cypripediums are very useful for furnishing a supply of cut flowers, as they will
keep fresh for several weeks in water, and will last for at least six weeks on the
plant.</p>
<p>These interesting plants are of easy cultivation, and occupy but little space,
hence they may be accommodated in every small collection, and may be grown
without much expense. The species and varieties forming the <i>barbatum</i> group, to
which this plant belongs, all require similar treatment. They may be grown either
in the Cattleya or East India house, and are best cultivated in pots. Some of
our Orchid-growers prefer to plant them in sphagnum moss, others in peat; for
ourselves, we prefer to use good fibrous peat, ample drainage being provided. We
have seen them thrive well in fibrous loam. The plants must be kept above the
rim of the pot, as they root freely over the surface of the rough material. Since
they have no fleshy bulbs to support them, and their growth is continuous almost
throughout the year, they require to be liberally supplied with water at the roots;
for this reason the pots must be well drained.</p>
<p>Insects require to be constantly searched for. The scale sometimes appears upon
the plants, but may easily be subjugated by sponging the surface with clean water.
Their greatest enemy, however, is the red thrips, which must be hunted up and
destroyed if the health of the plants is to be maintained, but it may be easily
kept under if promptly, perseveringly, and vigorously attacked.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Dendrobium macrophyllum.</span>&mdash;We have received two splendid spikes of this
magnificent Dendrobe, with flowers of an unusually fine colour, from a well grown
specimen, such as we might expect from so experienced a grower as Mr. Penny,
of the Royal Gardens, Sandringham, who has been one of the most successful
exhibitors of specimen Orchids at our London shows, where he has, with the large
collections staged by him, carried off nearly all the leading prizes. We hope at
some future period to be able to figure this fine Dendrobium, the sepals and petals of
which are of a rose-magenta colour, and the lip of the same colour, with a
purplish crimson throat. We received with the Dendrobe a fine spike of the white-lipped
form of <i>Odontoglossum Hallii</i> in grand condition, the sepals and petals being
of a very bright golden yellow with rich markings of a brownish crimson colour.
This variety forms a splendid contrast with the white-flowered <i>O. Alexandr&aelig;</i> and
<i>O. Pescatorei</i>, of which kinds there is a fine collection at Sandringham. The
Prince of Wales is a great admirer of these as well as of other good Orchids.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This is one of the most distinct of the new hybrid Lady&rsquo;s Slippers that have
been recently introduced to the notice of Orchid-growers; it will also be appreciated
as one of the most useful, being of a neat free-growing and abundant-blooming habit
of growth. The Cypripediums are everybody&rsquo;s plants, that is to say, any one who has
a place adapted for their cultivation can manage them without difficulty. Many growers
make them their especial care and study, procuring every species and variety that
can be obtained, and thus forming a very interesting and diverse group.</p>
<p>Our present subject was raised by Robert Warner, Esq., in whose collection at
Broomfield it has been blooming very abundantly, and it was from Mr. Warner&rsquo;s
plant that our drawing was taken. The variety resembles the one figured on plate
36 in being of free-blooming habit, and also in being very attractive in regard to
its foliage as well as its flowers. Many hybrid Cypripediums have been raised in
this country of late years by the Messrs. Veitch and Sons, and also by other growers.
Some of these have proved to be very beautiful and effective subjects, and no
doubt there are others coming forward that have not yet bloomed. Many splendid
novelties may yet be gained by crossing those kinds that have flowers of distinct
forms and colours, and, as many of the varieties bloom simultaneously, the hybridiser
will find abundant opportunities for carrying out his plans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>These plants appear to be easily raised from seeds, and to reach the flowering
stage sooner than most other seedling Orchids.</p>
<p>Some of the Cypripediums thrive well in a cool house, and by fertilising these
with the best of the stove species, a new set of cool-house forms would probably be
obtained. Such a result would be one of considerable importance to Orchidists, as
no doubt, if varieties of a different character to those we already possess could be
obtained, some of our enthusiastic growers would take up their cultivation in good
earnest. At present the majority of the Lady&rsquo;s Slippers require a warm house.</p>
<p><i>Cypripedium chloroneurum</i> is a dwarf compact-habited plant, with evergreen
foliage about six inches in length, beautifully variegated with closely chequered
markings of dark and light green. The flowers are produced in January and February,
and continue on for several weeks. The colours are distinct and attractive, the broad
flat dorsal sepal being of a bright lively pale green striped with darker green nerves
and bordered with white, the petals suffused with purple on the upper half and
marked with black marginal warts, and the purplish lip freely ornamented with bold
dark purple reticulations, altogether presenting a remarkably effective appearance.</p>
<p>This novel hybrid grows freely when potted in rough fibrous peat with good
drainage. When in vigorous growth it requires a liberal supply of water at the
roots. Propagation is accomplished by dividing the plants after they have finished
blooming and are ready to start into fresh growth; they can then be divided with
safety by cutting off a back growth with a leading shoot in front of it, but care
must be taken in cutting that the remaining portion of the plant is provided with
an eye so placed as to break and form a new growth. When this young growth
has been made, the divided plant may be shaken out from the old soil and potted.
The offshoots should be placed in small pots until the following year, when, if they
have made good growth, they may require to be repotted. They must be kept
moist and in a plump condition, as they have only slender resources of their own
to rely upon, but they root freely. As the plants get established they will require
larger supplies of water, for which reason good drainage must be secured.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">A&euml;rides Leeanum.</span>&mdash;This novelty has bloomed in the collection of G. W. L.
Schofield, Esq., of New Hall, Hey, Rawtenstall, near Manchester, producing four
flower-spikes. It is a beautiful object, its spikes of richly-coloured rosy pink blossoms
hanging gracefully from the plant. It is very distinct from any other species of
<i>A&euml;rides</i>, and will doubtless become a great favourite. One of its great recommendations
is that it blooms in the winter, which is not the case with the generality of these
plants, their usual flowering season being during the spring and summer months. <i>A.
Leeanum</i> is a small growing plant, but produces its spikes of blossoms very freely; and
requiring, as it does, but a limited space for its accommodation, it will be a most
useful introduction for amateur cultivators.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

of which nearly every colour occurs&mdash;bright yellow, pure white, rich crimson, bright
purple, soft mauve, rich orange, nankeen, and many others being found among the
many and various habited species of Dendrobes.</p>
<p><i>Dendrobium bigibbum</i>, the subject of our plate, is a species of a remarkably
beautiful and showy character, which, until within the last few years, has been
somewhat rare. In 1876, however, we received a large consignment from our collector,
Mr. Goldie, who was then on his way to New Guinea, and who met with it growing on
an island in Torres Straits, it having hitherto, we believe, been found only on the
mainland of Australia. These plants were very fine, some of the specimens being of
enormous dimensions, with stems quite two feet long, and from one and a-half to
two inches in circumference. The specimens from which our figure of one of the
most charming forms of this species which we have yet seen, was prepared, were kindly
sent to us from the fine collection of the Marquess of Lothian, at Newbattle Abbey.

Dalkeith, where it bloomed in September last in full beauty, amongst many other
notable Orchids which are well cultivated by the intelligent gardener, Mr. Priest, who
takes great delight in the careful management of his plants.</p>
<p>This species of <i>Dendrobium</i> is partially deciduous, the fully ripened stems
sometimes losing the whole of their foliage, while the young growths retain their
leaves until the following year. It grows from one to two feet in height, and
produces its racemes of flowers sometimes from the top of the young growths, and
sometimes from the old stems, in the latter case often bearing many spikes on the
same stem. The flowers are of a rich rosy purple, and last in perfection for a
considerable period. It is a most useful subject for associating with a button-hole
bouquet, single flowers being shown off to great advantage by placing a light-looking
fern frond behind them. The racemes of flowers last a long time after being cut if
placed in water, and are most useful in all floral decorations. By growing several
plants, successional blooms may be had at different periods.</p>
<p>This Tropical Australian species is best grown in a warm house, as the plants
require a good amount of heat&mdash;70&deg; to 80&deg; while growing&mdash;and plenty of light, but
the burning rays of the sun must be kept from them. They thrive best when
planted in pans or baskets amongst rough fibrous peat and sphagnum moss, and
suspended from the roof of the Orchid house. During the summer season they
require a liberal supply of water, but in winter should have only sufficient to keep
the stems plump. The plant will also succeed on blocks of wood, but, if grown in
this way, it will in hot weather need watering twice a day, and once a day at
other times. Some cultivators have been unsuccessful with this species, but we
have found it to thrive well in a house where Crotons, Dipladenias, Stephanotis, etc.,
are grown; the Dendrobes seem to enjoy the moisture transmitted to them by the
stove plants which are generally syringed in warm weather, and the dew arising
from this operation appears to suit the Orchid. The syringe is also useful in subduing
the red spider, which will sometimes attack the young growth. Insects often infest
those kinds of <i>Dendrobium</i> that are grown in strong heat, but they must by this and
other means be kept under.</p>
<p>Such treatment suits almost all the popular Dendrobes, namely, <i>D. Devonianum</i>,
<i>D. Wardianum superbum</i>, <i>D. chrysanthum</i>, <i>D. superbum (macrophyllum)</i>, <i>D.
crassinode</i>, etc.; and the plants are found to be much stronger by reason of hanging
near the glass well exposed to light, in which position they can be syringed on
warm days&mdash;this moistening not only invigorating their growth, but being also a
means of keeping insects under control.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>There can be no doubt that the species of <i>Phal&aelig;nopsis</i> rank amongst our
finest Orchids, on account of the purity and soft tinting of their blossoms and the
profusion in which they are produced. Unfortunately, at present, we only possess a
limited number of them. During the last few years, indeed, many new kinds, which
are giving a fresh interest to the genus, have been introduced by our collectors; and,
although it is barely possible that any new introduction should surpass the old species,
yet it is gratifying to know that there are yet to be found distinct and novel kinds of
great beauty. <i>P. Stuartiana</i>, which we now bring under the notice of our readers, is
a very fine and well-marked species, recently imported from the East by Messrs. Low &amp;
Co., of Upper Clapton, and named by Professor Reichenbach in honour of Mr. Stuart
Low, who is one of the largest importers of this class of Orchids. Our plate,
which represents the variety called <i>P. Stuartiana nobilis</i>, was sketched from a plant
now in the fine collection of William Lee, Esq., of Downside, Leatherhead, who
purchased it when in full beauty from the Messrs. Low, and we have to thank
Mr. Lee for his kindness in allowing the drawing to be made. It is to be hoped
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
that collectors may find more of it in its native country, although we believe it to be
very rare, and, like many other recent discoveries to be probably a natural hybrid
produced by insect fertilisation. We have no doubt that there are yet many fine
forms of <i>Phal&aelig;nopsis</i>; and if we could but obtain the scarlet one, which some years
ago was reported to have been seen by a collector who was not able to bring it
home, what a grand acquisition that would be!</p>
<p><i>Phal&aelig;nopsis Stuartiana nobilis</i> resembles <i>P. Schilleriana</i> in the young growth, its
newly developed leaves being of the same shape and colour and similarly spotted, but
the older leaves assume more of the character of <i>P. amabilis</i>; while the flowers,
instead of being mauve-coloured, are pure white, with the inferior halves of the
lateral sepals yellow and boldly spotted with cinnamon-red, as also is a portion of
the lip, the side lobes of which bear smaller and more closely set spots. We
have little doubt that this plant is a wild hybrid between <i>P. Schilleriana</i> and <i>P.
amabilis</i>, as though the young leaves come spotted, they afterwards change to the
colour of those of <i>P. amabilis</i>, as already described.</p>
<p>This plant requires the same treatment as <i>P. Schilleriana</i>, and is best grown
among sphagnum moss in baskets suspended from the roof, care being taken to give
it a good supply of water during the growing season. It should have the heat of
the East India house, and should at all times be kept moist at the roots, for if
allowed to become dry, it will loose its lower leaves. If the plants are in a healthy
and free-growing condition, flowering does not injure them; but, if at all sickly, they
should not be allowed to blossom until they regain strength and vigour, as they are
naturally free-flowering plants, and under such circumstances might bloom themselves
to death. The moss about their roots must be sweet and in a living state; when
it becomes decayed it should be removed, the roots washed, and the plant replaced
in clean live moss with fresh free drainage, so that the water, of which a
considerable quantity is required, may never become stagnant. Shading is an
important element in the successful cultivation of these plants; therefore the sun, when
at its full power in summer, must never be allowed to shine upon them, but in
winter a little sun-heat is beneficial, and they then require all the light which it is
possible to give them. Neither drip, nor water in any other form, must be
suffered to reach the hearts of the plants, as it causes them to rot.</p>
<p>Insects are troublesome at times. The thrips, if allowed to multiply, will greatly
disfigure the plants, causing damage by depriving them of the juices which should
go to sustain their vigour. When free from such pests, and in a healthy
condition, the leaves of the Phal&aelig;nopsids have a pleasing appearance; and, if they
are well looked after, it will not be difficult to keep them clean, the more especially
as being of large size, they can be readily operated upon.</p>

<p>This is a most charming small-growing Orchid, with remarkably pretty delicately
coloured flowers. It is at the present time very rare in collections, and, in fact, had
become almost lost to cultivation, but fortunately during the last year a small number
of plants was imported into this country and distributed. Our drawing was made
from a plant which formed part of this importation, and which produced its chastely
coloured blossoms in the Victoria Nursery. Many years ago we remember to have
seen a fine lot imported by the late George Ure Skinner, Esq., but since then it has
until last year disappeared from our notice. We are, however, glad to see it again
making its appearance in our Orchid-houses; for, as will be seen by reference to our
illustration, it is a plant of a most distinct and pleasing character, and will be a
real acquisition to the group of Odontoglots, of which numerous highly popular
species are at present in cultivation.</p>
<p><i>Odontoglossum Krameri</i> is a plant of compact-growing habit, with small flattened
light green pseudobulbs, each producing from the top a solitary leaf of a pale green colour.
The plant generally attains about ten inches in height. The flower spikes or peduncles
are freely produced from the base of the pseudobulbs after they have completed their
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
growth, several flowers being produced on each peduncle. The sepals and petals are
of a rosy lilac colour, margined with white; the lip is also rosy lilac, but of a darker
shade, flushed with yellow and marked and spotted with purple at the neck, and
having two semi-circular bands of dark purplish rose and white near the base. The
plants continue in bloom for several weeks.</p>
<p>We have found this species to thrive well in the Cattleya house, planted in
small pans or pots with good peat and sphagnum moss. It might possibly do in
a cooler structure, but we have as yet only cultivated it in the Cattleya house, and
this treatment has been found to suit it. It requires to be kept moist during the
growing season, but when at rest should have only just sufficient water to keep it
in a plump condition. The plant possesses one great advantage&mdash;that of blooming
during the autumn months, when such flowers are so much in request. It has also
another good quality&mdash;that of occupying but a small space, so that any cultivator
who has a spare niche in his Orchid house can grow it without any inconvenience.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cattleya Trian&aelig;.</span>&mdash;R. B. Dodgson, Esq., of Blackburn, has kindly sent us a
wonderfully fine series of flowers of the different varieties of <i>C. Trian&aelig;</i>, including
some of the grandest that have yet come under our notice. Of two or three of these
our Artist is preparing plates, which will be issued in due course in the <i>Orchid Album</i>.
The variety named <i>C. Trian&aelig; Dodgsoni</i> bears most beautiful flowers, which are quite
distinct from all that we have previously seen, the sepals and petals being large, and
of a pure white, while the lip is of a rich magenta colour, with the throat rich orange,
white in the upper part. <i>C. Trian&aelig; Osmani</i> is also a very fine variety, the flowers
being rich in colour, the sepals and petals rosy pink, and the lip large, of a bright
magenta colour; it is in fact altogether a wonderfully fine flower. There were
several other varieties sent, including one which we have selected as the original
<i>C. Trian&aelig;</i>; this we shall first bring under the notice of our readers, and the other
two will follow.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Mr. Dorman&rsquo;s Orchids.</span>&mdash;When visiting this grand collection last month (March) we
noticed the rare <i>Epidendrum Wallisii</i> in flower. Mr. Coningsby, the gardener,
informed us that the flowers on this plant had been open since November, and
they still looked fresh. <i>L&aelig;lia flava</i> was also good. <i>Galeandra Devoniana</i>, a plant
one seldom sees in bloom, was quite at home here, flowering and growing luxuriantly.
<i>Lycaste Skinneri alba</i>, with its pure white flowers looked very charming; this was
an extra fine variety, with flowers as large as any we remember to have seen. In
addition to these there were many fine things in flower, which space will not permit
us to mention. Mr. Dorman&rsquo;s Orchids are looking remarkably well, and are well
cared for, both employer and gardener being enthusiastically fond of them.&mdash;H. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>A grand Orchid which was first introduced to this country from Madagascar by
the Horticultural Society of London, through their collector, Mr. Forbes, in the third
decade of the present century, that is, more than fifty years since. It is, without
doubt, one of the finest of the species, and when well grown forms a noble plant, its
long spikes of attractive flowers, in company with its bold and characteristic foliage
and its majestic habit of growth, imparting to it an aspect of dignity which no one
can fail to recognise. Indeed, the magnificent appearance it has when placed on
the central stage of the East India house is quite sufficient to win for it the favour
of Orchid fanciers.</p>
<p>Wherever space can be given to it, it should always be grown, as it blooms
during the winter months and continues in perfection for many weeks longer than
any other of its family that has come under our notice. Our drawing was taken
from a very fine specimen, producing three well developed spikes, in the collection
of D. B. Crawshay, Esq., Rosefield, Sevenoaks, Kent, who is a great lover of Orchids,
and is forming a nice collection of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p><i>Angr&aelig;cum eburneum</i> is, as we have before noted, from Madagascar, and
consequently requires the heat of the East India house. It is of comparatively easy
cultivation. The strap-shaped leaves grow to about eighteen inches in length, and
are of a pleasant glossy, light green colour; the flower spikes are produced from the
leaf axils on each side of the stem, and extend to the length of eighteen inches,
bearing many flowers of which the broad cordate lip is of a conspicuous ivory white.
The plants will sometimes produce as many as four spikes at one time. The blooming
period is in December, January, and February.</p>
<p>There is in cultivation another variety of <i>Angr&aelig;cum eburneum</i>, called <i>virens</i>, but
is not nearly so handsome and effective a plant as the type, its flowers being of a
greenish white, but the spike has a somewhat more graceful contour, and the foliage
is of a dark green colour, so that it also is worth cultivating where room can be
found for its accommodation.</p>
<p>The Angr&aelig;cums form a very interesting genus in the great Orchid family; and
although amongst those that have bloomed in this country there are not many that
we consider to be worth growing as ornamental plants, yet some, on the other
hand, are very beautiful, and these we hope to be able to figure in due course. There
have been several new introductions of late, and no doubt there are many yet to
be acquired. We are glad to notice that Sir Trevor Lawrence is getting up a
collection of all the best kinds, but it is found that some of them are difficult to
obtain, and they are none of them so readily imported alive as many other Orchids
are. They are mostly found growing on trees in their native country, different
species being met with on the same trees. It was very interesting to hear the
late Rev. W. Ellis talk of these plants, of which many years ago he brought home
living specimens of some of the most beautiful of the species, such as <i>Angr&aelig;cum
sesquipedale</i>, <i>A. Ellisii</i>, and others.</p>
<p><i>Angr&aelig;cum eburneum</i> is best cultivated in a pot as it is a large growing plant,
and produces thick fleshy roots. We find sphagnum moss to suit it well, but it
must have good drainage as it requires a liberal supply of water during the summer
months, for if it be allowed to shrivel the bottom leaves wither and decay; in the
winter, on the other hand, it should have merely sufficient to keep the moss damp
and the plant in a plump condition. It requires the same general treatment as the
large growing Vandas, such as <i>Vanda suavis</i>, <i>V. tricolor</i>, and others. The plants
are not subject to the attacks of insects, their thick fleshy leaves appearing to have
no attraction for these pests.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Cattleya Trian&aelig;.</span>&mdash;We have received from E. Wright, Esq., Gravelly Hill,
Birmingham, a very fine form of this splendid <i>Cattleya</i>; the flowers were six inches
in diameter, the sepals and petals broad and of a rosy pink colour, the lip of a rich
magenta and beautifully fringed, having the throat bright orange colour and the upper
part rose-pink. It is altogether a desirable and charming flower. The varieties of
this species are very useful, as they bloom in winter, when there are but few other
Cattleyas in flower.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

<p>This is a magnificent Orchid, especially in the case of its finer varieties, whether
superior on the score of size or colouration. It was first bloomed by the Messrs.
Loddiges in 1839, in their wonderful plant emporium at Hackney, having been
introduced by them from the Philippine Islands. A grand variety called <i>giganteum</i>,
having flowers of immense size, is figured in Mr. R. Warner&rsquo;s <i>Select Orchidaceous
Plants</i> (1 ser., t. 26); and in respect to colour, the form of which we now give
an illustration, is one of the richest and most effective we have yet seen. The materials
from which our figure was prepared were obligingly sent to us by Mr. C. Penny,
gardener to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, at Sandringham. It will be at once seen
that the specimen in question was a well-grown example, and we understand that
the plant yielded two similarly well furnished wreaths, bearing as many as forty
blossoms. Besides this there are many other Orchids of superior merit to be seen
in the collection at Sandringham gardens, these plants, the magnates of the vegetable
world, being highly appreciated both by the Prince and the Princess of Wales.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>The Dendrobiums are among the most beautiful and charming of our Indian
Orchids, many of the species being of a most graceful habit of growth, and by
their brightly coloured flowers imparting a remarkably picturesque character to our
Orchid houses. Some of them, moreover, have delicately fragrant blossoms. In very
many cases they bloom most profusely, and with their long pendent stems look well
suspended from the roof of the house. Our present subject belongs to this latter
class, and is one of the most showy and beautiful of the species.</p>
<p><i>Dendrobium superbum</i>, which is more commonly known in gardens as <i>Dendrobium
macrophyllum</i>, is a deciduous plant, losing its foliage just as it begins to blossom.
It is a noble object when growing, producing stems from two to three feet long,
furnished along each side with flowers growing in pairs; these flowers are four inches
across, with sepals and petals of a lively magenta-rose, and a lip similar in colour,
but with a purplish crimson throat. It blooms during February and March, the
individual blossoms lasting about a fortnight in beauty. It thrives best when grown
in a basket, and suspended from the roof. If hung up when in blossom, amongst
the foliage of the other plants, the flowers are shown off to greater advantage, as
it naturally blooms without foliage. It grows well in the East India Orchid house,
and requires a good amount of heat and moisture during its growing season. After
growth is completed it will do well in the Cattleya house during the dormant period,
and when it begins to show its flower buds a little water may be given to induce
the buds to swell and develop fine flowers. When the flowering season is over it
may, if required, be placed in fresh sphagnum moss. It is a free growing plant,
and thrives best suspended near the glass in the full light, but shaded from the
burning sun. It is, indeed, absolutely necessary to give it all the light possible;
and, in summer, a slight syringing when the house is closed will tend to keep the
red spider and thrips in check.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Dendrobium Hillii.</span>&mdash;There is in the collection of R. Wyatt, Esq., Lake House,
Cheltenham, a very fine specimen of this cool Orchid, which has been bearing numerous
spikes of blossom, some of the spikes being as much as twenty inches in length. The
specimen was a most beautiful object, with its long racemes of creamy white blossoms,
which proceed from the apices of its thick fleshy pseudobulbs; it has, moreover,
dark green foliage. This plant was growing in the conservatory, and had continued in
bloom for about two months, so that it is a most useful subject for winter decoration.
It is a very old Orchid, but is worth cultivating, especially as it will grow in a
conservatory or in any cool house. There was also in the same collection a very
fine variety of <i>Cypripedium villosum</i>, one of the best we have seen, the flowers
being wonderfully bright in colour, and of large size. Of <i>Lycaste Skinneri</i> there was
a well-grown plant, with very fine flowers, the sepals and petals being broad and pure
white, and the front portion of the lip bright magenta, with the throat white.</p>

<p>This very distinct variety is one which will become very useful in the decoration
of our cool Orchid houses, for as the white-flowered varieties of <i>Odontoglossum
Alexandr&aelig;</i> and other species are now so numerous, that now before us, being yellow,
will produce a good contrast, which we must have in order to make a pleasing
display. Our drawing was taken from a fine example in the collection of G. Hardy,
Esq., Pickering Lodge, Timperley, near Manchester. We may add that Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s
is one of the largest and best collections in the North of England, since he spares
neither trouble nor expense in procuring the best varieties that can be obtained. As
a proof of this we may refer to the recent Manchester Whitsuntide flower shows,
where Orchids are one of the prominent features, and where Mr. Hardy&rsquo;s collection
has frequently taken high honours.</p>
<p><i>Odontoglossum Alexandr&aelig; flaveolum</i> is a compact free-growing plant, like
<i>O. Alexandr&aelig;</i> itself, and produces fine drooping flower spikes which we have seen
bearing fifteen expanded bright creamy yellow flowers, these continuing in beauty for
several weeks. This variety is all the more useful because of its blooming in the
winter months when so many of our white Odontoglots are also in flower. The
plant requires the same treatment as others of its class. It was found growing on
the branches of trees intermixed with <i>Odontoglossum Alexandr&aelig;</i>, and no doubt, as is
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
probably the case with others of the so-called new varieties, it has originated by
intercrossing with some allied species, which may have been growing near to it, and
has been flowering at the same time. We hope shortly to give an illustration of the
original or typical form of <i>O. Alexandr&aelig;</i>.</p>
<p>The best material in which to grow the Odontoglots is fibrous peat; they must
have good drainage because they want plenty of water during the growing season,
in fact the material should always be kept moist. The plants must never be over-potted,
but just sufficient root room must be permitted them to secure healthy
progression; over-potting, indeed, often becomes dangerous. We find that live
sphagnum moss placed on the top of the peat is a great help in their cultivation, as
it holds water, and there is always some degree of moisture arising from it; moreover,
when it is kept in a healthy growing state it has a very neat and pleasing
appearance.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Odontoglossums at Trentham.</span>&mdash;The <i>r&eacute;gime</i> adopted at Trentham for growing
Cool Orchids, such as Odontoglots, is to give them water most profusely, the cold
rain-water which falls from the roof being used summer and winter, and to allow
fresh air to circulate freely amongst them at all times, night and day, except in
very severe weather. The natural water at Trentham, as does any other water
containing lime, will, after a time, kill the Sphagnum used for potting purposes, and
this is most inimical to the plants, which never thrive so well as when the Sphagnum
keeps fresh and in a growing state. In respect to the Sphagnum Moss used for Orchid
growing, it does not appear to be generally known that amongst the different
species the best for potting Odontoglots and similar plants is a dense-growing
compact kind, whose very compactness gives it a sponge-like consistency, and enables
it to suck up and retain water freely. This is what the Odontoglots like.&mdash;T. M.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Odontoglossum Roezlii.</span>&mdash;A fine example of this showy Orchid has reached us
from D. Todd, Esq., Eastwood Park, near Glasgow. The spike was a particularly fine
one, bearing well-developed flowers, of which the sepals and petals were white, the
lower part of the latter being of a dark magenta, and the lip white, coloured with lines
of crimson on the disk. Mr. Todd grows these plants remarkably well, and deserves
great credit for his felicitous treatment of them, as few persons are so successful in
their cultivation. There is a very good collection of Orchids forming at this place,
Mr. Todd being an admirer of good kinds. At the Glasgow exhibitions his fine
collection forms one of the greatest attractions of the show.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This is one of the most chaste and beautiful Orchids of its class. The type,
<i>L&aelig;lia anceps</i>, has flowers of a rosy lilac and deep purple colour, while the one before
us is pure white with the exception of the lip, which is of a rich sparkling purple,
and makes a splendid contrast.</p>
<p>This variety was imported many years ago by the Messrs. Low &amp; Co., of Clapton.
There have been several other white forms flowered lately, but none to equal the
one represented in our plate, the drawing of which was taken from a very fine
specimen bearing four spikes, growing in the rich collection of R. B. Dodgson, Esq.,
of Blackburn; it was the finest plant we have seen in bloom, and the production of
so grand a specimen reflects great credit on Mr. Osman, the Gardener, for his skill
in cultivation.</p>
<p><i>L&aelig;lia anceps Dawsoni</i> is, like the type form, of compact-growing habit. The
pseudobulbs are from four to six inches in height, and the foliage of a light green
colour. The flower spike is developed at the tip of the pseudobulb after it has
completed its growth, and attains to about two feet in length, generally bearing two
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
or three blossoms at the end; the sepals and petals are pure white, of good form
and substance, and the lip is of a dark rosy purple edged with white, the disk orange
coloured, the lower part of the throat pale orange veined with crimson, and the upper
part white. It generally blooms in January and February, and continues in perfection
for two and three weeks.</p>
<p>This variety must be very rare in its native habitat, as we have received
importations on several occasions purporting to be this white form, but after the
plants have been grown on and flowered, they have invariably proved to be the
type with rosy-coloured flowers. This is also the experience of other importers of
Orchids.</p>
<p>The plant is best grown in a pot or basket suspended from the roof, where it
can obtain all the light possible, which induces it to grow with greater vigour and
to flower more freely. It thrives well in the Cattleya house with a moderate supply
of water in the growing season, but when at rest less water will suffice. We have
found good rough fibrous peat to be the most advantageous material in which to
grow it, allowing ample drainage; and when fresh potting material is required the
operation of supplying it should be performed just as the plant begins to grow,
which is after the blooming season. Always bear in mind that the plants must be
kept free from insects.</p>
<p>Propagation is effected by dividing the plant just as it begins to break into
growth. In performing the operation two or three pseudobulbs should be detached
from the plant, having a leading bulb; when taken off at this stage the plants
soon become established.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Dendrobium Wardianum.</span>&mdash;A fine variety of this grand Dendrobe comes from
D. Alroy Salamon, Esq., Clapham Park. The specimen has very large flowers,
four and a-half inches in diameter, and of great substance. The sepals and petals are
one and a-quarter inch broad, of a pure white, heavily tipped with rich magenta; the
lip is very large, and also heavily blotched with magenta, the throat being rich orange
with two dark brown eye-like spots. These flowers were from an imported plant,
and we are curious to see whether it will produce equally fine flowers from the home
made growths. If so we shall hope to figure it at some future time, as in the state
in which it has just bloomed, it is certainly one of the finest and best forms of this
splendid species which we have met with. It is also a free grower.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Dendrobium Falconeri.</span>&mdash;Mr. Priest, Gardener to the Marquis of Lothian, has
sent us some fine flowers of this favourite Dendrobe. He informs us that the plant
from which the flowers were taken has 150 blossoms upon it. This must be a remarkably
fine specimen, and well cultivated, to produce flowers in such profusion.&mdash;H. W.</p>

<p>This very charming species of <i>Cattleya</i> was first obtained from Colombia for
European gardens, in 1856, by Mr. Linden, to whom we are indebted for so many
choice introductions amongst exotic plants. It is one of the best and most useful
of the species, especially for winter decoration, and though very variable as regards
the tinting of the flowers in the many distinct forms which have been imported, it
is always of a brilliant and strikingly beautiful appearance, owing to the rich
colouring displayed on the lip. The shades of colour in the several kinds varies
from pure White through blush white and pale pinkish rose to a pale shade of deep
rose, the upper lobe of the lip being of a rich magenta-crimson.</p>
<p>There are, as we have just said, many forms of <i>Cattleya Trian&aelig;</i>. That which
we now figure we consider to be a very good representative of the typical form of
the species. Our drawing was taken from a very fine specimen grown in the
beautiful collection of R. B. Dodgson, Esq., of Beardwood, Blackburn, in which
many forms of this lovely species occur, as we have already intimated under
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
<a href="#fig40">Plate 40</a>. We have also mentioned Mr. Osman as being a most successful cultivator
of Orchidaceous plants.</p>
<p><i>Cattleya Trian&aelig;</i> is a free-growing as well as a free-blooming species. It has
dark green foliage, and attains the height of about fifteen inches, producing its
blossoms during the winter months, after the growths are completed. The sepals
and petals are of a pale pink or delicate tint of rosy purple; the lip is of a
bright magenta, margined with delicate rose-pink, the edge being fringed, and the
disk marked with a rich orange-coloured two-lobed blotch. The flowers are produced
in February and March, and continue for several weeks in perfection, provided they
are kept free from moisture, which if it lodges upon them will cause them to
become spotted, and destroy their beauty. It is an excellent plan to place the
plants when in bloom in a drier house than that in which they are grown, and to
bestow all possible care upon their preservation. Of themselves they form a fine
group of Cattleyas, there being so many distinct varieties, of colours such as to
make them thoroughly useful for decorative purposes. By their agency our Orchid
houses may be kept gay for several months in the most dreary time of the year,
for when there is a number of plants they may be flowered in succession. The
plants can now be bought at a reasonable price, as, in consequence of the large
importations of them, they have become plentiful.</p>
<p><i>Cattleya Trian&aelig;</i> requires the same treatment as <i>C. labiata</i>, <i>C. Mossi&aelig;</i>, and
others of the same class, all these plants being, indeed, regarded by some botanists
as varieties of one species. For their successful growth the use of good fibrous
peat and sphagnum moss, with ample drainage, are requisite, and they should be
kept well elevated above the pot rim. They will also thrive well suspended from
the roof in baskets, and also on blocks of wood, but in these cases they require
more attention as to watering, in order to keep them moist at the roots.</p>
<p>Cattleyas thrive best when placed under the influence of strong light, but they
must be shaded from bright sunshine. This <i>r&eacute;gime</i> induces them to blossom more
freely, indeed, if the bulbs are not well ripened good results cannot be anticipated.
The plants require a plentiful supply of water during the growing season, by which
we mean that they should be kept constantly moist about the roots. When their
growth is completed less may be applied, merely enough to keep them in a plump
state. When the flower spikes begin to appear more water should again be
given, as it will induce the buds to swell more freely, in consequence of which the
flowers will be finer.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>This genus of Orchids is not a very extensive one, but among the species
which are known there are some beautiful plants of distinct and striking character.
The species which we now represent is a very pretty one, which we are pleased
to have the opportunity of introducing to the notice of our readers. The specimen
figured was grown in the fine collection of W. Cobb, Esq., of Sydenham, who is
a great lover of Orchids, and makes it a study to procure the best kinds and
cultivate them in the best possible manner.</p>
<p><i>Miltonia cuneata</i> was introduced by the Messrs. Rollisson, of Tooting, about
the year 1843, and first flowered with them in the spring of 1844. It is a free-growing
plant, with light green foliage, which grows about a foot in height, and
produces its flowers in erect racemes, seven or often more together. The sepals
and petals are chestnut-brown, tipped with greenish yellow, and the lip is broad
and of a creamy white colour. The flowers are produced in February and March,
and last for several weeks in beauty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>This <i>Miltonia</i> requires the heat of the Cattleya house, and thrives in good
fibrous peat; it must be well drained in order that the superfluous moisture may
pass off, as the plant dislikes stagnant water about the roots. In the growing
season a moderate supply of water may be given at the roots, but less will suffice
when the growth is completed. We find the Miltonias to require more shade than
most Orchids. Their leaves are thin in texture, and consequently are soon injured,
which makes it necessary to pay strict attention to the requirements of the plants,
as while too much sun would dry up the foliage, too much moisture about it would
cause it to go spotted.</p>
<p>They are propagated by dividing the bulbs, leaving two old ones and a growth
in front. These divided portions should be potted in small pots until they get
well established, and always at all times be kept free from insects. The white
scale will sometimes attack them, and do much injury if not promptly removed.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">L&aelig;lia elegans prasiata.</span>&mdash;From E. Harvey, Esq., Aigburth, Liverpool, comes a
spike of a grand form of this fine <i>L&aelig;lia</i>. The flowers are six inches across, the
sepals and petals purplish rose, the lip rich magenta. This is quite a distinct
form, and worthy of a place in every collection. Accompanying this was a spike
of <i>Scuticaria Hadweni</i>, var. <i>pardalina</i>, described some time ago in the <i>Gardeners&rsquo;

<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Dendrobium nobile (three-lipped).</span>&mdash;Mr. Knight, Gardener to the Right Hon.
W. H. Smith, M.P., Greenlands, Henley-on-Thames, sends us a curious form of
this grand old Orchid, with three lips, two of the lips taking the place of the
petals of the normal flowers, and being marked and coloured in a similar manner
to the ordinary lip. In addition, the flower was deliciously scented. We do
not suppose that this variation will be constant, being more probably a malformation.&mdash;B.
S. W.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Bollea c&oelig;lestis as a block plant.</span>&mdash;When visiting the establishment of
Messrs. Vervaet et Cie., of Gand, Belgium, in April last, we were surprised to see
this lovely Orchid quite at home on a block, growing luxuriantly, and rooting in
all directions; the growths were very strong, and as healthy as any we have seen.
Is it possible that this may be the secret of success with this Orchid? Being an
epiphyte, found growing on the limbs of trees, we should imagine this treatment
would be the most natural for it. It is evident that pot culture does not suit
it, as it frequently dies off after two or three years.&mdash;H. W.</p>

</blockquote><hr />
<p>The Princess of Wales&rsquo; Odontoglossum, one of the most beautiful and one of
the most useful of Orchids, was found in the province of Bogota, in New Grenada,
at an altitude of from 7,000 to 8,000 feet, growing in great profusion on the
branches of trees in the forests of that elevated region. It was introduced to this
country in 1864 by Mr. Weir, when collecting for the Royal Horticultural Society,
and was described in that year by Mr. Bateman as above quoted. There cannot
be two opinions respecting its beauty, as it is one of the best Orchids in
cultivation; and though there are amongst the imported plants great diversities in
the form and colour of the flowers, yet all are beautiful. Some have the flowers
of a pure white, in others they are variously suffused with a delicate rosy hue;
some are spotted with crimson, and there are those with yellow flowers, but the
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
most chaste and beautiful of them all are the pure white varieties, tinted with
rose colour, which are mostly sought after by cultivators, though the many beautifully
spotted forms produce a fine contrast when intermixed with the others.</p>
<p>The figure we now publish was taken from a well-grown specimen in the
collection of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, at Sandringham, and, as this species is
named in honour of the Princess of Wales, who is a great lover of flowers, and
especially of the Orchidace&aelig;, we are proud to be able to announce that our artist
has been permitted to prepare an illustration of this charming plant from such a
source. There is a very fine collection of these plants at Sandringham, and among
them are some very fine specimens, the accomplished gardener, Mr. C. Penny,
being most successful in flowering them with grand spikes of bloom. There are
also numerous varieties in the collection, but the one we have figured is a good
example of the typical form.</p>
<p><i>Odontoglossum Alexandr&aelig;</i> is a compact-growing plant, attaining about a foot in
height; it is furnished with lively green foliage, and produces its blossoms after the
growth is completed on a drooping spike which, as it overhangs the green foliage,
has a most graceful appearance. The sepals are white, slightly tinged with pale
rose colour, the petals are pure white, and the lip is white, with reddish-brown
spots upon it, and a patch of bright orange-yellow at the base. The plants bloom
at different times of the year, according to the period of the completion of their
growth, and, therefore, by having a good quantity of plants, a succession may be
kept flowering all the year round. We are never without a good show of these
plants in bloom, and it is the same in all collections where they are grown in
considerable numbers. The individual flowers will last many weeks in beauty. They
are extremely useful for cutting, as they keep for a long time in water.</p>
<p>As this species requires what is called cool treatment very little expense need
be incurred in its cultivation. Indeed, any one having a small house where a
temperature can be kept up in winter of from 45&deg; to 50&deg;, with as little fire-heat as
possible, can grow a great quantity of them, since they occupy but little space. In
summer no fire-heat is required, unless the nights are cold, which is seldom the
case at that season, but no draughts should be allowed to reach them, as draughts
are as deleterious to them as to all other plants grown in glass houses. They
require shading from the scorching rays of the sun, but like to have all the light
that can be given them. Under this treatment they will grow stronger and stronger,
and flower more and more freely.</p>
<p>The potting material which we find most suitable for them is good fibrous
peat, with the finer earthy particles shaken out; they must have good drainage, in
fact the pots must be three-parts filled with drainage material, and the plants well
elevated above the pot rim. They are naturally free-rooting plants, but we find a
little live sphagnum moss on the top of the peat causes them to root more
freely, and as they require a good deal of moisture at the roots during their
period of growth, the moss, if kept in a growing condition, will help to supply
their wants.</p>

<p>The Vandas are a most noble family of Orchids, including amongst them many
beautiful species, such as <i>V. suavis</i>, <i>V. tricolor</i>, <i>V. Batemanni</i>, and others. They
are well furnished with leaves, and make splendid specimens, requiring considerable
space in which to grow them, but they are plants of great beauty, and when not
in bloom make grand objects of attraction. No collection should be without them,
as they flower at all times of the year. Where a number of these Orchids are
grown, as at Chatsworth, we have seen as many as 193 spikes in blossom at one
time, presenting a most glorious sight.</p>
<p>The Vandas are of easy cultivation. The species which we now figure is a
small, elegant-growing, free-blooming plant, and also very distinct in character, as
will be seen from the plate, which gives a good representation of it. Our drawing
was taken from a beautiful specimen growing in the splendid collection of
C. Dorman, Esq., The Firs, Laurie Park, Sydenham, who has one of the best
grown collections of Orchids we have seen, and one which does great credit to
Mr. Coningsby, the gardener.</p>
<p><i>Vanda c&oelig;rulescens</i> is a compact growing species, as may be seen from our
plate. In this instance it produced a flower spike of a drooping habit fifteen inches
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
long, which is quite an exception, as the flower spikes are generally more or less
erect or ascending. The sepals and petals are of a bluish-mauve, the lip of a deep
blue. It is altogether most distinct in colour, and a plant that is greatly required
in a collection of Orchids for the sake of the charming contrasts it yields. It
blooms at different times of the year, and continues for several weeks in beauty.
We find the heat of the East India house is congenial to it. It grows well in
sphagnum moss, and must have good drainage, because it must be kept moist
during the growing season; when at rest less moisture is required. The plant
thrives either in a pot or in a basket suspended from the roof, so that it may
get plenty of light, but must be shaded from the sun.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Odontoglossum Alexandr&aelig; regin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;F. A. Philbrick, Esq., Oldfield, Bickley,
has sent us two fine spikes of this grand variety, the white flowers of which are
of good form and profusely blotched, both on the sepals and petals, with reddish
crimson. It is one of the finest spotted forms of this valuable species.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>
<hr /><p class="tb"><span class="sc">Orchids from Perth</span>, N.B.&mdash;We have received from W. Macdonald, Esq.,
Woodlands, Perth, a nice spike of <i>Scuticaria Steelii</i>, with three flowers. This is
a curious growing Orchid, and one seldom sees it in blossom. The flowers are
produced from the base of the reed-like leaves, and are yellow, distinctly spotted
with crimson. The plant makes a fine specimen for a block, and when suspended
from the roof shows off its leaves and flowers to advantage. Accompanying this
was a spike of a fine variety of <i>Odontoglossum Pescatorei</i>, with flowers measuring
three and a half inches across. Mr. Macdonald informs us that this spike was
produced from a plant with small bulbs, and he expects, as the plant gets
stronger, that it will produce larger flowers. There was also in flower at The
Woodlands a grand specimen of <i>Camarotis purpurea</i>, with about 100 spikes of its
pretty rosy pink flowers fully open.&mdash;B. S. W.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
